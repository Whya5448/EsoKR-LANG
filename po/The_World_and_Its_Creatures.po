"The valley known as \"\"The Lion's Den\"\" was so named because it "
"historically served as a breeding ground for mountain lions. The Nedic "
"peoples of the late Merethic era hunted this population for its furs, but "
"modern inhabitants of the Rift tend to stay clear of the area, finding it "
"easier and safer to harvest the skins and furs of domesticated livestock.\n"
"\n"
"The local populace undoubtedly began to avoid the Lion's Den early in the "
"Second Era, when a small tribe of giants took up residence in the nearby "
"mountains. These giants have been characterized by locals as angry hermits, "
"and have been known to attack trespassers on sight. For this reason the "
"entrance to the valley was walled off, preventing anyone from accidentally "

"Incorporating Fragment Two \n"
"\n"
"Translated and With Commentary by Florin Jaliil\n"
"\n"
"The rolling verdant hills of southern High Rock are unmistakable in the "
"previous verse (Fragment One), recognizable to anyone who has been there. "
"The question, of course, is what is to be made of this apparent reference to "
"Orcs occupying the region. Tradition has it that the Orcs were not born "
"until after the Aldmer had settled the mainland, that they sprung up as a "
"distinct race following the famous battle between Trinimac and Boethiah at "
"the time of Resdayn.\n"
"\n"
"It is possible that the tradition is wrong. Perhaps the Orcs were an "
"aboriginal tribe predating the Aldmeri colonization. Perhaps these were a "
"cursed folk—\"\"Orsimer\"\" in the Aldmeris, the same word for "
"\"\"Orc\"\"—of a different kind, whose name was to be given the Orcs in a "
"different era. It is regrettable that the fragment ends here, for more clues "
"to the truth are undoubtedly lost.\n"
"\n"
"What's missing between the first fragment and the second is appreciable. It "
"must be more than eighty months that have passed, because Topal is on the "
"opposite side of mainland Tamriel now, attempting to sail southwest to "
"return to Firsthold, after his failure at finding Old Ehlnofey.\n"
"\n"
"Fragment Two:\n"
"\n"
"No passage westward could be found in the steely cliffs\n"
"That jutted up like giant's jaw, so the Niben\n"
"Sailed south.\n"
"As it passed a sandy, forested island that promised\n"
"Sanctuary and peace, the crew cheered in joy.\n"
"Then exultation turned to terror as a great shadow rose\n"
"From the trees on leathered wings like a unfurling Cape.\n"
"The great bat lizard was large as the ship, but good pilot\n"
"Topal merely raised his bow, and struck it in its head.\n"
"As it fell, he asked his bosun, \"\"Do you think it's dead?\"\"\n"
"And before it struck the white-bearded waves, he\n"
"Shot once more its heart to be certain.\n"
"And so for another forty days and six, the Niben sailed south\n"
"\n"
"We can see that in addition to Topal's prowess as a navigator, cartographer, "
"survivalist, and raconteur, he is a master of archery. It may be poetic "
"license, of course, but we do have archeological proof that the Merethic "
"Aldmer were sophisticated archers. Their bows of layers of wood and horn "
"drawn by silver silk thread are beautiful, and still, I have heard experts "
"say millennia later, very deadly.\n"
"\n"
"It is tempting to imagine it a dragon, but the creature that Topal faces at "
"the beginning of this fragment sounds like an ancestor of the cliff-racer of "
"present day Morrowind. The treacherous cliff coastline sounds like the "
"region around Necrom, and the island of Gorne may be where the nest of the "
"\"\"bat lizard\"\" is. No creatures like that exist in eastern Morrowind to "
"my knowledge at the present day."

"The Lucky Old Lady\n"
"\n"
"By Sathyr Longleat\n"
"\n"
"Very little is left of the Ayleid presence in Bravil of today, though "
"architectural marvels of other kinds are very evident. As beautiful and "
"arresting as the Benevolence of Mara cathedral and the lord's palace are, no "
"manmade structure in Bravil is as famous as the statue called The Lucky Old "
"Lady. \n"
"\n"
"The tales about the Lady and who she was are too numerous to list.\n"
"\n"
"It was said she was born the illegitimate daughter of a prostitute in "
"Bravil, certainly an inauspicious beginning to a lucky life. She was teased "
"by the other children, who forever asked her who her father was. Every day, "
"she would run back to her little shack in tears from their cruelty.\n"
"\n"
"One day, a priest of Stendarr came to Bravil to do charitable work. He saw "
"the weeping little girl, and when asked, she told him the cause of her "
"misery: she didn't know who her father was.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You have kind eyes and a mouth that tells no lies,\"\" replied the "
"priest after a moment, smiling. \"\"You are clearly a child of Stendarr, the "
"God of Mercy, Charity, and Well-Earned Luck.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The priest's thoughtful words changed the girl forever. Whenever she was "
"asked who her father was, she would cheerfully reply, \"\"I am a child of "
"Luck.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"She grew up to be a barmaid, it was said, kind and generous to her "
"customers, frequently allowing them to pay when they were able to. On a "
"particularly rainy night, she gave shelter to a young man dressed in rags, "
"who not only had no money to pay, but was belligerent and rude to her as she "
"fed him and gave him a room. The next morning, he left without so much as a "
"thank you. Her friends and family admonished her, saying that she had to be "
"careful, he might have even been dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"A week later, a royal carriage arrived in Bravil, with an Imperial prince "
"within. Though he was scarcely recognizable, it was the same young man the "
"Lady had helped. He apologized profusely for his appearance and behavior, "
"explaining that he had been kidnapped and cursed by a band of witches, and "
"it wasn't until later he had returned to his senses. The Lady was showered "
"with riches, which she, of course, generously shared with all the people of "
"Bravil, where she lived to a content old age.\n"
"\n"
"No one knows when the statue to her was erected in the town square, or who "
"the artist was, but it has stood there for thousands of years, since the "
"First Era. To this day, visitors and Bravillians alike go to the Lucky Old "
"Lady to ask for her to bless them with luck in their travails.\n"

"\n"
"사제의 사려 깊은 말이 소녀의 인생을 바꾸었다. 이제 아버지가 누구냐는 질문을 받을 때마다, 그녀는 해맑게 대답했다. "
"\\\\\"\\\\\"나는 행운의 아이에요.\\\\\"\\\\\"\n"
"\n"
"그녀는 바텐더로 자랐으며, 돈을 낼 수 있을 때 내도 좋다고 할 만큼 손님들에게 관대했다고 한다. 특히 비가 많이 오던 어느 날, 그녀는 "
"누더기 옷을 입은 젊은 남자에게 잠자리와 음식을 제공해 주었다. 그는 돈도 없었고, 적대적이며 무례했다. 다음 날 아침 그는 고맙다는 "
"말조차 없이 떠났다. 그녀의 가족들과 친구들은 그 남자가 위험한 사람이었을 수도 있다며 그녀에게 조심해야 한다고 말했다.\n"
"\n"
"일주일 후, 임페리얼 왕자를 태운 왕실 마차가 브라빌에 도착했다. 거의 알아보기 힘들었지만, 그녀가 도와주었던 바로 그 젊은이였다. 그는 "
"당시 그의 행색과 태도에 대해 거듭 사과하며, 그가 마녀 집단에 납치되어 저주받았고 그가 제정신을 찾은 것은 그녀와 만나고 훨씬 "
"이후였다고 설명했다. 그녀는 엄청난 부를 획득했고, 물론 브라빌의 모든 사람과 그 부를 나누어 가졌다. 그녀는 브라빌에서 만족스런 노후를 "
"보냈다.\n"
"\n"
"마을의 광장에 그녀의 동상이 세워진 것이 언제인지, 혹은 동상이 누구의 작품인지는 아무도 모른다. 하지만 동상은 첫 번째 시대 이후로 쭉 "
"그곳에 서 있다. 오늘날까지, 브라빌 주민과 외지인 모두 그녀가 내리는 행운의 축복을 바란다.\n"
"\n"
"행운 가득하고 아름다운 마을인 브라빌에 더해진 또 하나의 아름다움이다."

"To the outside observer, the assorted peoples of the region of High Rock "

"that most people in the region take their cues for culture, architecture, "

"dismiss the cultural differences between the larger populations and the "
"multitude of diverse subcultures present throughout the region.\n"
"\n"
"Daenia: Dominated by the cultural influence of Daggerfall, Daenia is the "
"home and heartland of Breton's quest obsession. For those unfamiliar with "
"the term, it refers to the practice by which young members of the poor and "
"serf classes can partake in heroic tasks to elevate themselves to the ranks "
"of the nobility. The cultural narratives of Daenia are filled with tales of "
"the lowly taking on a great quest to win the respect and accolades of those "
"above them. It is my suspicion that the famed independent spirit of the "
"Daenian people is an extension of this narrative of upward mobility. Of "
"note, this area is also home to the Wyrd subculture, and several witches' "
"covens dedicated to the worship of nature inhabit the vast forests of Daenia."
"\n"
"\n"
"Cambray Hills: Camlorn and its surrounding villages are a hodgepodge of "
"different Breton cultures. The nobility of Camlorn fancy themselves an "
"aristocracy of poets and artists. Often taking a pacifistic tact in the "
"dealings between Daggerfall and Wayrest, Camlorn has benefited much as a go-"
"between for trade and an open market for goods from both Iliac Bay and the "
"Eltheric Ocean. The Cambray Hills are well-known as being haunted, and any "
"given member of the populace usually has a unique ghost story or two to "
"share. The largest subculture of note are the swamp-dwelling Bretons of the "
"eastern bogs that stretch from the Hag Fen to Aldcroft.\n"
"\n"
"King's Guard: This region is so named for the mountainous ridge that form a "
"natural barrier between Glenumbra, Rivenspire, and Stormhaven. Crosswych is "
"a crossroads for trade moving between these major regions of High Rock, and "
"the place has become a melting pot of dress, food, and culture of the Breton "
"city-states. Not so much a subculture, but a subgroup of note for King's "
"Guard is the Red Rook bandit clan. While the Red Rooks are present "
"throughout Glenumbra, they originated in the mountains and foothills of "
"King's Guard as a loose collection of hunters and highwaymen that preyed "

"Glenumbra is notorious for being haunted. It is important to explain what I "
"mean by haunted. Not every undead is a haunt. Only ghosts can cause a "
"haunting. Ghosts are the spirits of people who were once as alive as you or "
"I. When they died, they refused to leave. \n"
"\n"
"(If at any point you experience the dark effects of necromancy, know that "
"this is not a haunting and should be reported to the proper authorities.) \n"
"\n"
"Everyone in Glenumbra has a tale to tell about a spook, spectre, or haunt. "
"You need only ask. \n"
"\n"
"Without a doubt the most haunted place in Glenumbra are the moors northwest "
"of Aldcroft. As everyone knows, this was the site of the Battle of "
"Glenumbria Moors in the First Era. This great battle saw the near-"
"simultaneous destruction of both the Alessian Order and the Direnni Elves on "
"one field of battle. Such a tragedy suffuses this place with spectral energy."
" Wandering the moors, many travelers report hearing the sounds of conflict "
"in the distance.\n"
"\n"
"The second most haunted place in Glenumbra is directly related to the first. "
"Cath Bedraud and the burial mounds surrounding it began as a mass grave for "
"the fallen soldiers of the battle of Glenumbria Moors. It is advised that "
"you do not stray into the cemetery during times of heavy fog. Ghostly lights "
"and moans have been reported there.\n"
"\n"
"While some consider the woodlands of Daenia to be haunted, this is actually "
"a misconception. Many spirits of nature, including the famed Guardians, "
"inhabit the vale and forest. These are not ghosts, for they were never "
"people. These creatures were born as spirits and should be treated with the "
"respect they deserve.\n"
"\n"
"Hearkening from Glenumbra's past of feudal division, the countryside is "
"dotted with ruins and castles, each of which you could probably find someone "
"to tell you a spooky story about. In particular, the ruins at Baelborne Rock "
"and Dresan Keep have many a local legend surrounding them. \n"
"\n"
"Of all the haunted sites in Glenumbra, I would give strongest caution "
"against a trip to the village of Westtry. Westtry suffered some form of "
"terrible magical event that has left it infested with the undead. It is not "
"safe, nor would I suggest anyone go ghost hunting there."

"It was once believed that the Maormer of Pyandonea were originally exiles "
"from the Summerset Isles, but while it is likely they came from similar "
"Aldmeri ancestors, they certainly did not come from Summerset. Translations "
"of tapestries in the Crystal Tower tell the tale of a far older separation. "
"The Maormer likely differentiated from the ancient Aldmer not in Summerset, "
"but in their original homeland of Aldmeris.\n"
"\n"
"Orgnum, their leader and self-styled \"\"King,\"\" according to the legend "
"was a phenomenally wealthy Aldmeri nobleman, who used his fortune to finance "
"a rebellion against the powers of the land. He and his followers were "
"banished for this to a place separated from Aldmeris by an impenetrable "
"mist, Pyandonea, \"\"The Mist-Veiled Isles.\"\" This exile proved so "
"effective that the followers of Orgnum never again disturbed their former "
"countrymen. The new Aldmeri homeland of Summerset, however, was not so lucky."
"\n"
"\n"
"For much of Summerset's history, the Maormer have launched attacks against "
"their cousins of Old Ehlnofey. Every one of these battles has been led by "
"Orgnum himself, who it seems is not only immortal but grows more youthful by "
"the century. No historian, to the knowledge of the staff of the Imperial "
"Geographic Society, has counted the number of wars and stratagems employed "
"against Summerset, but somehow each has proved, no matter how ingenious, an "
"ultimate failure.\n"
"\n"
"One attack in particular is worthy of mention as it gives us our only "
"glimpse into the actual landscape of Pyandonea. In the year 2E 486, a small "
"Maormeri fleet was sighted off the coast of Alinor, and King Hidellith "
"ordered his navy to give chase. The navy followed the ships through "
"uncharted waters, into an ambush near Pyandonea itself. Most of the Altmeri "
"navy was destroyed, but a single warship returned to Summerset to describe "
"the land as a \"\"sea jungle.\"\" Massive plateaus spilling over with "
"vegetation form mazes around valleys of ocean. Waving tendrils of kelp trap "
"all but the Maormer's own ships, and provide a well-camouflaged home for the "
"sea serpents that are Orgnum's guards and occasional mounts. Mist storms "
"spill over the land, further disorienting one's views. That even one ship "
"survived the visit is a testament to the maritime genius of the Altmer."

"Skyrim! It has existed since the creation of the world. And Skyrim has "
"always had giants. That is the truth. I have studied these lumbering "
"creatures and watched them tend their mammoths. They are peaceful, simple "
"beings. Not all have given in to their battlelust. Not all have given in to "
"the need to explore that drives every Nord I have ever known.\n"
"\n"
"But nonetheless, we are connected to these giants, for we both share a "
"common ancestor. The Atmorans were huge and smart. Nords descended from "
"these ancient folk became the small (relatively speaking), intelligent "
"people that we are today. Giants, on the other hand, became the huge, stupid "
"creatures that we watch from a distance. Once we honored our cousins with "
"offerings of cows, but this practice has fallen out of favor. Perhaps that "
"is to the detriment of Nord villages everywhere.\n"
"\n"
"Today, most Nords refuse to acknowledge the obvious connection between us "
"and the giants. We treat the giants as a nuisance, steal their grazing "
"lands, and even hunt their mammoths for sport. This will be our undoing. To "
"disrespect the giants is to disrespect ourselves. If we can't learn to live "
"with our huge cousins, I fear that conflict could become all-out war. And "
"that would be a shame.\n"
"\n"
"Let me tell you more about the giants. In general, they tend to be solitary "
"creatures. The giants do gather regularly at a ceremonial site. Here, they "
"come together to trade, mate, and communicate with whatever simple methods "
"they have developed. \n"
"\n"
"They have a curious relationship with their mammoths. They don't herd these "
"creatures, but they seem to be able to communicate with them. They protect "
"them, and in return, they get milk, cheese, and companionship. On occasion, "
"I have seen a giant eat a mammoth. The meal was conducted with reverence, if "
"such a concept can be applied to a simple giant.\n"
"\n"
"Giants also demonstrate intricate beliefs regarding death. They have places "
"set aside as sacred burial grounds. When a giant is sick or dying, he or she "
"goes to one of these places to die. If a giant dies elsewhere, other giants "
"make sure the body gets to the burial ground. They don't live near these "
"sacred locations, and they don't guard them. They simply make use of them.\n"
"\n"
"Giants and Nords continue to vie for some of the same territories. Future "
"conflict is inevitable unless we take steps to find peaceful solutions. "
"Giants fall, and Nords die, but I have never seen a giant eat a Nord."

"By Phrastus of Elinhir\n"
"\n"
"It is an indisputable fact that necromancy, the foulest of all magical "
"endeavors, is on the rise. Word of unsettled spirits, shambling corpses, and "
"worse spreads across Tamriel, planting seeds of fear in common folk. There "
"is good reason to be concerned, and it is my scholarly duty to inform the "
"ignorant in hopes that a more educated populace will be better prepared to "
"recognize and face undead dangers.\n"
"\n"
"Necromancy, as you likely know, is the manipulation of souls, soul energies, "
"or corpses of the dead. Unwilling spirits are often involved, and in the "
"eyes of any rational being, the \"\"study\"\" of this type of magic is "
"repellant. It should not be surprising to you that much knowledge of "
"necromancy is attributed to Daedric forces, specifically those of the "
"abhorrent Molag Bal, further cementing it as a sphere that must be shunned. \n"
"\n"
"I present to you now an accounting of the general types of undead:\n"
"\n"
"The Reanimated\n"
"\n"
"These monstrosities are formed when a necromancer summons and instills an "
"enslaved spirit, often a minor Daedric essence, into a corpse or construct "
"of bodies. Reanimations take many shapes, from the lowly skeleton (favorite "
"of novice necromancers) to the hulking flesh atronach. The need for "
"unconsecrated corpses poses a danger to communities, as it is known to drive "
"wayward mages to murder in their lust for power. To minimize encounters with "
"reanimations, avoid poorly-kept graveyards and hidden caves or ruins, and "
"report any suspicion of necromancy to your local authorities for "
"investigation.\n"
"\n"
"The Returned\n"
"\n"
"Ghosts, wraiths, and spectres manifest for a variety of reasons. Some are "
"bound to Nirn through powerful curses, some are summoned forth through "
"rituals, and others find their souls unable or unwilling to depart due to "
"unfinished business. Some are even ancestors bound by their own families, a "
"practice the Dark Elves claim is not necromancy at all—guarwash! \n"
"\n"
"My recent studies into the phenomenon known as the Soulburst indicate a tie "
"between it and a surge in returned sightings and activity, strongly "
"implicating a persistent disruption in natural post-extant soul conveyance. "
"Detractors to this theory, notably the misguided Lady Cinnabar of Taneth, "
"have yet to produce any counter-theories that do not crumble under the "
"slightest scrutiny.\n"
"\n"
"The Accursed\n"
"\n"
"Undeath is not always a product of renegade mages tampering with souls and "
"rotting flesh. Cursed diseases such as Noxophilic Sanguivoria can corrupt "
"the living. The result is an undead creature that requires the blood of the "
"living for sustenance. Vampires have a tendency to organize into reclusive "
"clans, hiding away beneath the ground and surfacing only to obtain more "
"thralls to feed upon. In some cases, though, their minds are known to "
"degrade to the point of insanity, leaving a raging husk of a creature with "
"no mental capacity commonly called a \"\"bloodfiend.\"\" Any sightings of "
"such creatures should be reported to a local Fighters Guild. \n"
"\n"
"Abominable Miscegenations \n"
"\n"
"Some undead defy simple classification. The lich, for one, is a corpse that "
"is self-reanimated by the soul it bore in life. Typically, only powerful "
"spellcasters seeking immortality achieve this state. Luckily for common "
"folk, liches are often focused obsessively on continuing their own studies, "
"and they are not likely to be encountered by travelers that keep their noses "
"out of ancient ruins. \n"
"\n"
"Now that you are more informed about this vile art and its repellent "
"products, hopefully you are better-prepared to assess undead threats. It "
"goes without saying (though I will certainly say it) that we all have a "
"responsibility to report and combat necromancy, especially in these times. "
"Do not let anyone convince you that there is some kind of benefit to be had "
"in exploring these detestable magics—any reasonable individual can see the "
"madness in such a claim."

"\n"
"What's that? You want to know about the Glenumbra Banks? I thought everyone "
"knew about those shifting sand bars off the northwest coast of High Rock, "
"the narrow islets that make seafaring there so dangerous close to shore. I "
"myself have made a living for almost thirty years as a Daggerfall pilot, "
"guiding merchant ships through the Banks in and out of the city's North "
"Docks. And I'm well paid for the job, but the merchants don't complain—they "
"see the rotting spars and twisted planks of the shipwrecks we pass as we "
"wend our way through the channels. \n"
"\n"
"Those channels are treacherous and ever-changing. When we go out in early "
"Sun's Dawn to meet the first ship coming in to port after the winter storms, "
"there are always numerous visible changes to the waterways—as well as "
"invisible changes to their depths, which we must take care to map out by "
"frequent use of the plumb-line. \n"
"\n"
"But the fact is we must be ever on the lookout for changes in the Banks even "
"in Mid Year and Sun's Height. Now, how is it that the sands shift the way "
"they do, sometimes changing overnight even when there has been no storm? The "
"Herne Current runs far offshore, and in summer the breeze the mariners call "
"the Yokudan Zephyr blows steadily but gently from the west. \n"
"\n"
"And yet, the sands shift, and the Banks change. \n"
"\n"
"Well, stranger, I'll tell you the secret, so long as you're buying the "
"drinks tonight in the Rosy Lion. It's Ithguleoir. Yes, you heard me "
"right—the immortal leviathan of the Eltheric Ocean is no mere fable. "
"Ithguleoir lives, and haunts the far depths of the sea … and sometimes the "
"near shallows of the shore. He fills old channels in the Banks and dredges "
"new ones. And when a ship runs aground on the sands, he rises from the "
"waters and dines on its sailors, one by one. \n"
"\n"
"I suppose you're entitled to look skeptical about that—so long as you buy "
"another round, that is. But listen, I'm not just spinning an old salt's yarn."
" I've seen the thing. On nights when the moons are full and the sea is calm, "
"you can sometimes glimpse the leviathan's oily back heaving above the "
"surface as the old monstrosity digs his devious traps. Occasionally there's "
"a geyser of sea-mist, like when a whale blows, but then the breeze wafts "
"ashore a demonic stench that smells like it's blown from Oblivion. \n"
"\n"
"So there: now you know. But let's just keep this between you, me, and the "
"tavernkeeper's cat, shall we? The south harbor's too shallow for the big "
"merchantmen, and Daggerfall depends on her sea-trade continuing to find its "
"way in to the North Docks. As do I. And sailors are such a superstitious "
"lot—no point in scaring them away. Eh?"

"A copy of the full manuscript should follow this letter shortly. This is but "
"an abstract to satisfy your curiosity until the scribes can finish their "

"Common Vvardenfell Guar\n"
"\n"
"Guar are but the most commonly-known species of a large family of bipedal, "
"lizard-like creatures, having been imported to Cyrodiil as beasts of burden "
"for hundreds of years. They are content to graze with their lower jaws for "
"tubers and roots just under the surface of their ashland home. Wild guar are "
"mostly docile, but have been known to become feral and attack in the wilds "
"of some lands. Guar are fierce if provoked, and have been known to kill. "
"Their closest relatives are the Alit and Kagouti, also common in the lands "
"of Morrowind, as well as the pony guar. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"Pony Guar,\"\" as nicknamed by visitors to Morrowind, are a smaller "
"species of guar that are rarely exported since they lack the physical "
"strength of their larger cousins. Not well known outside of southern "
"Morrowind, they are a curiosity sometimes raised as pets, but some do raise "
"them for their meat and skins. \n"
"\n"
"Alit and Kagouti\n"
"\n"
"Alit are close relatives to the guar, with far sharper sets of teeth. They "
"are omnivores and while they do not hunt in organized packs, they have been "
"known to attack other creatures and even people for an opportunistic meal. "
"Alit supplement their nutrition, much like the guar, by rooting. For many "
"years, it became the vogue for exotic animal enthusiasts from Valenwood to "
"import alit for their own amusement. Many escaped captivity, and their "
"descendants can be found stalking the great forests of the southwest. \n"
"\n"
"Kagouti are large, armored cousins of the guar and the alit. Their most "
"distinctive features are their tusks and head crests. They are territorial, "
"fierce, and hostile. They hunt in packs and have been known to be able to "
"flip a full-grown Nord in the air with ease. \n"
"\n"
"Scuttler and Bantam Guar\n"
"\n"
"The scuttler is a small, docile species of biped the size of a common "
"housecat. They have no apparent forelegs, and survive on eating smaller "
"insects and groundworms. Having completely different reproductive and growth "
"cycles, they are not related to the guar or alit. Scuttlers are more similar "
"to the cliff racer family of leathery flyers than their form would suggest. "
"Smugglers have sold them as pets in ports from Daggerfall to Haven. \n"
"\n"
"Bantam Guar, despite their name, classify as a part of the scuttler family "
"and are not guar at all. Many have described them as \"\"ugly chickens,\"\" "
"as they have a distinctive body shape and behavior that remind many of the "
"common bird. They retain the vestigial wings, and unlike their cliff racer "
"and cliff darter cousins, they cannot fly. Southern Morrowind farmers raise "
"them for their eggs and meat."

"Cormount was once a sleepy trading post, a common stop for those traveling "
"from Haven to Reaper's March. No scholars agree on who founded the town, but "
"we do know Cormount's population and cultural significance grew tenfold "
"shortly before the end of the Long Truce.\n"
"\n"
"Cormount's quiet surroundings and distance from the Wood Elf seat of power "
"made it an ideal hideaway, especially for the Camoran factions. Over the "
"years the cream of the Bosmer nobility took lovers in Cormount. But secrets "
"are like seeds—if you try to bury them, they will one day burst forth.\n"
"\n"
"In 2E 406, a scandal rocked the Camoran factions when it was revealed that "
"Cormount might be the source of dozens upon dozens of potential heirs, most "
"of whom were of marriageable age. Cormount nearly doubled its population in "
"one week as opportunists, the curious, and the cunning arrived in town. For "
"months thereafter, weddings were a daily occurrence.\n"
"\n"
"This rumor also drew many young Wood Elves who lived outside of Valenwood. "
"They traveled to the Kingdom of Grahtwood with the hopes of binding their "
"Imperial fortunes to their spiritual home. Those who found Grahtwood "
"agreeable founded a ramshackle village near Cormount called New Joy.\n"
"\n"
"The settlers were known as \"\"migrants\"\" by the Grahtwood natives who had "
"first arrived in Cormount. These adherents to the Green Pact were shocked by "
"the Cyrodilic customs of their wayward cousins. Meanwhile, the migrants "
"flaunted the \"\"backwoods\"\" nature of the natives, seeking easy pleasures "
"in the trade that flowed through Cormount.\n"
"\n"
"Tensions between Cormount and New Joy grew to a boiling point in the years "
"to follow. It is unknown who cast the first torch, but one dark night in 2E "
"420 the settlement of New Joy was burned to the ground. Those who fled were "
"slain—including a visiting Camoran noble.\n"
"\n"
"Though none took credit for this massacre, it was widely assumed the work of "
"Green Pact adherents of Cormount. In the few short years before the end of "
"the Long Truce, Camorans looking to air their grievances frequently used the "
"Razing of New Joy as a political cudgel.\n"
"\n"
"But Cormount should not be known for this one stain on its reputation. "
"Founded in 2E 489, the Blacksap Movement has grown in popularity throughout "
"Grahtwood. This Cormount-based cultural organization hopes to formalize the "
"Wood Elf approach to the Green Pact, thereby preventing the very "
"misunderstandings that led to the tragic events of New Joy. As we enter the "
"fifth century of our era, Cormount's rise seems all but assured. This author "
"can only hope the Blacksap rises with it!"

"1st Rain's Hand, 2729\n"
"(for distribution to all Imperial Citizens of Southpoint)\n"
"\n"
"Southpoint was founded by the great and magnanimous Governor Zantonius. This "
"you certainly know! But in the interest of understanding the magnitude of "
"this accomplishment, you must first understand the man who brought it to "
"fruition.\n"
"\n"
"Zantonius was born the eldest son of a Colovian farmer from Kvatch. After "
"her tragic death, Zantonius took a commanding role in his family. Despite "
"these humble upbringings, he was always the bright and cheerful man you may "
"know today!\n"
"\n"
"As Zantonius' younger siblings came into adulthood, he tired of his life as "
"a farmer. He soon set out to make a name for himself, traveling to the "
"Imperial City and enlisting in the Imperial Legion.\n"
"\n"
"Zantonius' rise in the legion's ranks was swift. His commanders said he was "
"strong as a bear and swift as a fox. Eventually Zantonius was assigned a "
"post in northern Valenwood, where he would prove he had a tactical mind "
"matching the greatest generals of the Second Empire!\n"
"\n"
"One dark night in the month of Second Seed, while Zantonius stood ever-"
"vigilant watch in Reman's Bluff, he single-handedly stopped a Wood Orc raid "
"upon his camp! For his merits in battle, Zantonius was given command of a "
"cohort of soldiers and sent to build a fort for the glory of the Empire. At "
"the head of these troops, Zantonius marched south into the Kingdom of "
"Grahtwood.\n"
"\n"
"It was the beautiful plot of land at the southernwestern tip of Grahtwood "
"where Zantonius thrust the point of his spear into the soil. \"\"From this "
"day forward, I declare this land to be known as Southpoint. Though sent to "
"build a stronghold of Imperial might, I will instead built a fortified town! "
"All in the Kingdom of Grahtwood will know Southpoint's name.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Can anyone doubt Governor Zantonius' word? He has given the citizens of "
"Southpoint strong walls, swift response to Bosmer insurrectionists, and a "
"port that sees far more ships than the backwater trading post of Haven. Next "
"month, Governor Zantonius shall break ground on what will one day become the "

"\n"
"Why, every citizen of Southpoint owes Governor Zantonius for their safety, "
"security, and prosperity! We shall support him in his rightful stewardship "
"of Southpoint, his valiant efforts to make Southpoint the center of Imperial "
"culture in Valenwood, and the increase in taxes which shall take effect at "
"month's end. Though we owe so much to Governor Zantonius for our town, all "
"he asks in return is our loyalty, our comity, and one gold for every twelve "
"earned.\n"

"The tale of Faltonia's Promise, or Goldfolly as it's commonly known, is a "
"tale of divination, greed, and foolishness. If you go to Grahtwood you can "
"still see what remains of the village, a run-down testament to the hubris of "
"one woman, Faltonia Salvius.\n"
"\n"
"Like many Imperials, Faltonia Salvius saw an opportunity to extract great "
"wealth from Grahtwood. Specifically, she sought rich veins of gold from the "
"nearby hills. She trusted diviners and alchemists of the lowest order, false "
"advisors who were happy enough to tell her what she wanted to hear as long "
"as their own purses grew fat.\n"
"\n"
"The more she paid them, the more willing she was to believe their lies. When "
"one lone voice, the alchemist Flavius Antonius, argued that the samples of "
"soil from the area were insufficient to predict large deposits of gold, she "
"had him arrested and beaten. From that point, he was unable to walk and was "
"forced to beg for his supper for the rest of his miserable days.\n"
"\n"
"Faltonia traveled to Grahtwood in springtime with a band of Imperial guards "
"numbering four-and-twenty, and proceeded to conscript local Wood Orcs as "
"labor in the fulfillment of her grand vision. By midsummer, a village had "
"been constructed on her chosen site, called Faltonia's Promise, and the Orcs "
"were set to work in the mine.\n"
"\n"
"How the gold flowed! How quickly eager prospectors flooded Faltonia's "
"Promise, dreaming of riches! How forcefully their dreams were dashed, when "
"within the year the mine was played out. \"\"Faltonia's Promise\"\" became "
"the punchline to a bitter joke told in taverns by out-of-work miners.\n"
"\n"
"Humbled but undaunted, Faltonia fought to save the settlement. Seeking to "
"turn the mining operation into a quarry, she haggled and negotiated with "
"nearby Haven to supply stone for the reconstruction of their crumbling "
"buildings. But just as the deal was about to be completed, a smooth-talking "
"Altmer canonreeve convinced the governor to supply Haven with stone from "
"Summerset, emphasizing the superior style and durability of island stone.\n"
"\n"
"Broken, and having spent the last of her fortune in a failed attempt to "
"bribe the officials in Haven and secure the stone deal, Faltonia left the "
"village that had been named for her. Many who had settled there in pursuit "
"of riches soon followed, dispersing to other settlements in Grahtwood, or "
"leaving entirely. So it was that Faltonia's Promise came to be referred to, "
"far and wide, as Goldfolly.\n"
"\n"
"The Orcs who remained eked out a living as hunters and grew into a stubborn "
"stock, the sort who saw it a badge of honor that they persisted in a place "
"that had driven so many away. On their lips, the name Faltonia's Promise "
"once again took on positive connotations, of persistence, strength, and an "
"indomitable spirit, thought the village would never reach the heights of "
"Faltonia's foolish dreams."

"Ragnthar is a mystery within a mystery. Modern scholars agree: there's just "
"no reason for Ragnthar to exist in the strange way it does. And that is "
"about all scholars can agree upon when it comes to the strange case of the "
"Ragnthar ruins. \n"
"\n"
"Even laypeople know that the Dwemer, or Dwarves as they're more commonly "
"known, vanished from the face of Tamriel. The reasons or cause behind their "
"disappearance are a matter of much speculation … a subject for numerous "
"other texts.\n"
"\n"
"What is not in dispute is what they left behind: numerous ruins, some still "
"patrolled by their unique metal constructs. Exploring a Dwarven ruin is seen "
"in many research and adventuring circles as a rite of passage, as even the "
"most well-trod ruin might still contain dangers. As a result, there's a "
"large body of work on the subject of Dwemeri ruins and their eccentricities. "
"\n"
"\n"
"To be sure, there are a number of unusual finds within the ancient Dwarven "
"holdfasts. Towering machinery, shafts that allow sunlight to reach thousands "
"of feet below ground, roaring waterfalls powering still-active and "
"incomprehensible machinery … there are many ruins that are stunning to the "
"eye and the senses.\n"
"\n"
"None of them match Ragnthar when it comes to stunning the mind. For you see, "
"Ragnthar has numerous entrances spread across Tamriel. It is literally a "
"space-out-of-space, twisted out of reality. Its physical location is "
"actually unknown! Observations made within the site suggest it once was "
"situated within the mountains of Hammerfell, but a precise origin point has "
"never been determined.\n"
"\n"
"What is known is that by stepping across the threshold into Ragnthar, you "
"leave Nirn. And no one knows why. \n"
"\n"
"For indeed, the greatest question posed by Ragnthar is: why? Why would the "
"Dwemer expend the enormous amounts of magical energy required to remove a "
"complex from known reality? I call this effort a \"\"Temporospatial "
"Claudication,\"\" literally a twisting of time and space.\n"
"\n"
"Herein you'll find this humble scholar's numerous observations about the "
"site. I've extensively studied the remaining constructs and machinery here, "
"as well as made numerous suppositions about the intent of its creators. I "
"think you'll agree, the more we learn about the site, the more there is to "
"uncover!"

"Reaper's March has a long and bloody history. Its denizens have had ample "
"need for a place to bury their dead. For the most respected, the rich, the "
"powerful, that final resting place has often been the crypt known as "
"Thibaut's Cairn. \n"
"\n"
"Located southwest of the village now called Greenhill, the old Colovian "
"crypt and the nearby village once shared a name. But … we're getting ahead "
"of ourselves.\n"
"\n"
"The Cairn is named for its most noted \"\"guest,\"\" the famed Thibault of "
"Kvatch. Thibault was a general of Colovia, and in his time some hundreds of "
"years ago he was one of the anchor points for the Hastrel Cohort. \n"
"\n"
"Those brave souls rode forth at the vanguard south, beside their comrades in "
"the Linchal and Ontus cohorts. The purpose of their ride has been forgotten, "
"just one of the numerous sorties into the March the Colovian kingdoms have "
"attempted over the years.\n"
"\n"
"Their ride would have been lost forever to the mists of time, if not for the "
"unique relationship Thibault had with his cohort. Riding at his side south "
"from the Kingdom of Kvatch was his wife Tertcia. Below Thibault in the "
"command structure of his cohort were his children, though the number he had "
"in place has now been lost to time. The members of his cohort owed him "
"personal allegiance to a degree not often seen in modern Colovian cohorts. "
"It's said when Thibault rode, even the nightsoil men of his township rode "
"with him.\n"
"\n"
"The details of Thibault's death, too, have been lost to us … but the impact "
"of his death is still easy to see if you travel south of Arenthia in the "
"Northern Woods. While the Linchal and Ontus cohorts rode back north, "
"returning to home soil, the men and women of Hastrel cohort stayed and put "
"down roots. \n"
"\n"
"Tertcia's need to see her husband's legacy built was the motive for staying. "
"The tales of her manipulations can be found in numerous other tomes, no "
"doubt. Suffice it to say that she played the Wood Elves against the Khajiit "
"and the Khajiit against the Wood Elves in a masterful dance. The result? A "
"complex of crypts and an entire village, once known simply as \"\"Thibault's "
"Rest\"\".\n"
"\n"

"\"\"Ice Fangs No. 4,\"\" one of the Master's favorite sculptures. Their "
"banishment, however, left a certain hard-to-define gap in our realm's "
"carefully-balanced esthetic of beautiful pain—an absent voice, if you will, "

"I admit it: I missed the way their lissome forms curveted and twirled at the "
"edge of vision, their expressions blank of all emotion but for the avid "
"hunger of the arsonist. I thus made it my purpose, when the duties of my "
"office could spare me, to find a substitute for the exiled flame atronachs, "
"some other conjurable entity that would replace the charismatic peril of "
"their presence.\n"
"\n"
"Availing myself of the spare transliminal scanner stored in the Tower of "
"Lies, I set myself the task of reviewing by survey all the Oblivion planes "
"within range of its infralux pseudocortex. I scanned over 37,000 different "
"planes, chaos realms, and pocket realities before I found what I was looking "
"for in DOP 9497.15, known to its curious inhabitants as \"\"The Fourth Sinus "
"of Takubar.\"\" I immediately recognized the plane as a sort of decalescent "
"inversion of DOP 6, \"\"Infernace,\"\" well known to conjurers of all races "
"as the home plane of the common flame atronach. In place of the extreme heat "
"of Infernace, where molten rock flows like water, in Takubar (as we may call "
"it for the sake of brevity) the bedrock is subjected to a cosmic degree of "
"cold, causing its material bonds to slide apart and the stone to flow like "
"cold lava. \n"
"\n"
"It was there in Takubar that I finally saw, in the insect-eyed lenses of the "
"transliminal scanner, images of gyrating atronachs that burned with cold "
"blue flames. I had found what I sought.\n"
"\n"
"After that, modifying Koron's Peremptory Summons to address Takubar rather "
"than Infernace was a matter of mere routine. Within seven shifts I had "
"succeeded in summoning what we may term a \"\"cold-flame atronach\"\" to "
"Coldharbour. As anticipated, rather than giving off unpleasant waves of "
"heat, this was an elemental of cold fire, and there was a steep drop in "
"ambient temperature in its presence. \n"
"\n"
"This, of course, was all to the good. \n"
"\n"
"In behavior my cold-flame atronach behaved in all ways like an ordinary "
"flame atronach—and was just as irritable, casting blue fireballs at any who "
"threatened it, and conjuring pillars of cold flame at need. This perfectly "
"fills the niche of hovering sentry formerly filled in Coldharbour by their "
"igneous cousins, and that is the main function they now fulfill in our "
"Master's realm."

"swarms of hornets, but even usually timid creatures like deer and elk. \n"
"\n"
"Whether these animal allies defend spriggans out of love or friendship, or "
"whether they are magically summoned by an innate spell ability on the part "
"of the spriggan, is an open question, and a matter of some debate among "
"those who study mystizoology. There is no doubt, however, that spriggans are "
"creatures of a magical nature, as is clearly evidenced by the powerful "
"qualities of the so-called \"\"taproots\"\" that are harvested from their "
"bodies when slain. These taproots are prized by alchemists for their "
"undeniable arcane properties, which enable the concoction of complex potions "
"from powerful reagents that are otherwise immiscible. \n"
"\n"
"As to their origins, that is a mystery that so far none have solved. We find "
"accounts of \"\"Spryggain Groaves\"\" dating all the way back to the "
"beginning of the First Era, as well as mention of \"\"tree-daughters\"\" in "
"the ancient myths of Y'ffre and the Earth Bones. Their common name seems to "
"derive from \"\"sprig,\"\" the Nedic term for a fresh green twig or "
"offshoot, but beyond that everything about their origins is obscure.\n"
"\n"
"From a purely physical standpoint spriggans certainly come in several forms, "
"with reports of a variety of barks and foliage. This may represent different "
"strains or sub-species, or it may simply be a reflection of the spriggan's "
"mystical connection with its local flora. Spriggans seem to resemble the "
"plants of the groves wherein they live, even reflecting the seasonal nature "
"of those who reside in the deciduous forests of northern Tamriel. In the "
"opinion of this scholar, the so-called spring, summer, autumn, and winter "
"spriggans are all the same creatures merely undergoing seasonal "
"metamorphosis.\n"
"\n"
"Some have gone so far as to assert that spriggans have a hierarchy, with "
"lesser members of the species owing allegiance to the greater, who are "
"sometimes termed \"\"spriggan matron\"\" or even \"\"spriggan earth mother."
"\"\" Here is where we must draw the line between scholarship and "
"storytelling: though a spriggan's form outwardly resembles that of a human "
"female, there is no evidence whatsoever that they can engage in intelligent "
"behavior, or that they can organize into hierarchical groups. The creatures "
"of the natural world, even those that are quasi-magical, behave entirely "
"according to instinct, and to endow them with human emotion or thought is "
"mere sentimentalism. If you're partial to that sort of fanciful twaddle, I "
"refer you to the works of Lady Cinnabar of Taneth, who produces it in great "
"reams."

"Gargoyles! Great misshapen humanoids, gray-green of skin, with gnarled, "
"tusked faces, horns, and pointed ears. Some are even said to have wings, "
"though the idea of these hulking brutes taking to the air is hard to credit. "
"But where do they come from, and why? Read on, for this great mystery at "
"last has a solution!\n"
"\n"
"Tales of gargoyles are widespread across Tamriel, but few can claim to have "
"actually seen one. (Have you ever seen one? Has anyone you know ever seen "
"one? I didn't think so. And I'm rarely wrong about such things. As you know "
"if you've read my other pamphlets. If you haven't read my other pamphlets "
"you are sadly under-informed, and have missed out on several life-changing "
"money-making opportunities. You would be wise to correct this deficiency.) \n"
"\n"
"But back to the business at hand: gargoyles! They're few and far between. "
"However, it is well known that they can be found deep in the depths of the "
"deserts of Hammerfell, hunkering atop crumbling crags as they gaze balefully "
"down upon their potential prey, preparing to dive and rend it with their "
"stony, taloned hands! Is it any wonder few have survived to tell of such an "
"encounter? \n"
"\n"
"At any event: Hammerfell, depths of the deserts thereof, that's where we "
"find our elusive gargoyles! But gargoyles are not the only legendary "
"denizens of the depths of the deserts, are they? No! In fact, according to "
"long-time Redguard legend, when those doughty warriors first arrived on the "
"shores of Tamriel they found the deserts of Hammerfell occupied by—Giant "
"Goblins!\n"
"\n"
"Giant Goblins! Goblins, but giant-sized! In other words: great misshapen "
"humanoids, gray-green of skin, with gnarled, tusked faces, horns, and "
"pointed ears. Where have we heard that before …?\n"
"\n"
"Revelation! Epiphany! You get it, do you not? Take a look at a Goblin, then "
"look at a gargoyle—very well, look at a picture of a gargoyle, because as I "
"believe we've established none of us have ever seen one in person—but "
"anyway, just look at them! Can such a resemblance be a coincidence? Well, I "
"don't know about you, but my mother didn't raise anyone that gullible! "
"Coincidence? My eye! It's as plain as their tusky faces that the Hammerfell "
"Giant Goblins (legendary) and the Hammerfell gargoyles (a matter of public "
"record) are, in point of fact, One And The Same. Why, a fool couldn't tell "
"them apart, blindfolded."

"\n"
"Much ink has been spilled, and much information and misinformation spread, "
"about the new city the Dominion has constructed in Valenwood.\n"
"\n"
"The most pernicious rumor is that Marbruk has been constructed, not in "
"cooperation with the Wood Elf inhabitants of the region, but as a city for "
"Altmer by the Altmer—an act of Dominon civic aggression.\n"
"\n"
"This could not be further from the truth: if Marbruk has been built with "
"Altmeri tastes in mind, it is for the sake of unity, not in spite of it. \n"
"\n"
"We can't say, on the one hand, that the Dominion is meant to foster "

"Elsweyr, the High Elf sequestered on Summerset, the Wood Elf deep in "
"Valenwood.\n"
"\n"
"Cyrodiil casts a long shadow from the north over Valenwood. Are we to defend "
"our brothers and sisters in Greenshade from a distance? \n"
"\n"
"No less damaging is the rumor that the Dominion has paid Altmer residents to "
"move to Marbruk. The only Altmer on the Dominion's payroll in Marbruk are "
"those that have to do with the government and protection of the city, as "
"would be the case in any other Dominion city. Wood Elves and Khajiit are "
"included in this number as well and receive identical compensation.\n"
"\n"
"The only payment the Dominion promises to those who will relocate to Marbruk "
"is a spot in the land and housing lottery for the remaining available "
"property. These are in limited quantities, but are given to ensure the "
"thriving of the settlement, as required by trade and the defense of the "
"region.\n"
"\n"
"It bears repeating that it is the duty of loyal Dominion citizens to support "

"Heart of Valenwood, heart of the living forest, is too easily mistaken for "
"an object, a single item, that can be claimed and manipulated. It is true "
"that in the heart of the forest there is a magnificent tree, through which "
"courses the metaphorical lifeblood of Valenwood. But to say that the tree is "
"the heart is to vastly limit one's understanding of the Heart.\n"
"\n"
"In truth, the Heart is more akin to the forest's soul. The magnificent tree "
"is just the physical symbol of that soul, but like a soul in the body, the "
"Heart is not in one place in the body, but suffused through the entire thing."
"\n"
"\n"
"Still, it's been apparent to anyone who wished to look that the ancient "
"Ayleid site of Hectahame holds immense power, far outstripping the rest of "
"Valenwood. As a consequence, that particular location is often referred to "
"in older texts as the \"\"Heart of Valenwood\"\" and has become the target "
"of numerous plots to harness that power for purposes both good and ill.\n"
"\n"
"One of the earliest of these plots occurred while the Ayleids first came to "
"Valenwood. A necromancer (his cursed name long lost to history) invaded "
"Valenwood with an undead army, and perverted the life-giving power of the "
"heart to raise up a formidable force of undead Ayleid spirits. The Ayleids "
"fought a long and protracted battle to defeat the army, but in the end they "
"were unable to defeat the army, only contain it.\n"
"\n"
"Using welkynd stones, the Ayleids created powerful necromantic wards to seal "
"off Hectahame, and the once great city became a prison for the army that had "
"sought to conquer it. The undead were returned to the ground and trapped "
"there. None who have attempted to break the wards have managed, and it is "
"speculated that only an object that could cancel magic itself could undo the "
"Ayleids' incredible handiwork.\n"
"\n"
"But it is because of the powerful wards on Hectahame that the Heart of "
"Valenwood is little understood and rarely spoken of. The Wood Elves view "
"Hectahame with a mix of superstition and awe, fearing the ancient past and "
"revering the life-giving power that seems to emanate from within.\n"
"\n"
"It is said that the last Wood Elf to enter Hectahame and behold the heart "
"was a Silvenar from over two hundred years ago. But even accounts from that "
"time suggest that he was viewed as mad by his contemporaries."

"Hello, fellow traveler, and welcome to this guide!\n"
"\n"
"Within these pages, I will explain everything you need to know about "
"fighting trolls, including how to negate their amazing healing powers and "
"how best to take advantage of their natural love of cold. I'll even share "
"with you my tried-and-true secret for killing trolls.\n"
"\n"
"Intrigued? I hope so! Troll fat is a valuable commodity and there's fortune "
"and glory to be made for the ambitious troll hunter.\n"
"\n"
"Onward, then!\n"
"\n"
"Chapter I:\n"
"\n"
"I Just Saw A Troll!\n"
"\n"
"If you think you've seen a troll, remain calm and slowly back away. The wise "
"hunter knows that preparation is the key to success, and you certainly don't "
"want to hunt any trolls unprepared!\n"
"\n"
"Ah, but is it really a troll that you've spotted?\n"
"\n"
"The first step in your hunt is the proper identification of your quarry. "
"Trolls are roughly man-shaped, with lengthy, muscular arms that end in claw-"
"tipped fingers. The creature's large mouth is filled with jagged teeth, all "
"the better to crunch the bones of foolish hunters who didn't purchase my "
"book. \n"
"\n"
"Without a doubt, the troll's most distinctive and unusual feature is the "
"third eye nestled in the center of its forehead.\n"
"\n"
"A troll's hide is covered in thick, shaggy fur. The coloration of this fur "
"varies by region. Cave troll fur is brownish in color, while a frost or snow "
"troll will have a white coat.\n"
"\n"
"Chapter II:\n"
"\n"
"Stop Healing Yourself\n"
"\n"
"So, you've properly identified a troll and now you're stalking the beast, "
"ready to strike. You're in for a challenging battle, but a profitable one, "
"assuming you survive.\n"
"\n"
"The first thing you'll notice is that trolls are incredibly fast and strong "
"for their size.  A troll likes to pummel its prey into submission with "
"powerful arm strikes and claw attacks. For this reason, I strongly recommend "
"a shield.\n"
"\n"
"If you're brave enough—or foolish enough—to fight a troll without using a "
"shield, then you'd better be an expert at parrying with whatever weapon "
"you've got.\n"
"\n"
"Trolls also have the ability to rapidly heal from their wounds. As such, you "
"do not want to get into a prolonged fight with one. Speed and aggression are "
"the key to beating a troll, because there is no creature in Tamriel that can "
"outlast one.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, speed and aggression will only take you so far against an angry "
"troll. This is where my secret weapon comes in.\n"
"\n"
"Chapter III:\n"
"\n"
"The Secret Weapon\n"
"\n"
"Fire, my friend. Say the word and commit it to memory, for fire is the troll-"
"hunter's ultimate weapon.\n"
"\n"
"I cannot overstate the importance of fire in battling a troll.  Even trolls "
"that don't dwell in cold climates are vulnerable to fire. If you're unable "
"to use fire magic, carry a weapon enchanted with arcane flames.\n"
"\n"
"Why is the troll vulnerable to fire? Rumor holds that the troll's "
"regenerative abilities are less effective at healing burns. I don't really "
"know the answer, but I can promise you this—fire works against trolls. This "
"has been proven time and again.\n"
"\n"
"Chapter IV:\n"
"\n"
"Trimming the Fat\n"
"\n"
"The troll might be dead, but your job isn't finished just yet.\n"
"\n"
"Let the flames die down and then examine the troll's corpse. If you're "
"lucky, you'll find some fat deposits that will fetch a good price in an "
"apothecary's shop. In fact, if you've got a knack for alchemy yourself, you "
"can boil the fat down for use in all manner of potions and tonics.\n"
"\n"
"If you can find it, be sure to check the troll's den as well. Perhaps you'll "
"find the remains of some foolish adventurer who was too cheap-minded to "
"purchase this book.\n"
"\n"
"No doubt you can put his coin to wiser use.\n"
"\n"
"Now you know everything that you need to make a living as a wealthy and "
"reputable troll hunter. Go on, then! Get out there and find yourself some "

"grew, yes, but only to the size of an ample millet-loaf, for it was not "
"needful for them to grow larger. For were they not favored of the children? "
"Did they not scamper, and race, and sing the clickety-song? And were they "
"not well-fed therefore, on seeds and savory dung-pellets?\n"
"\n"
"Aye, it was so.\n"
"\n"
"And the lives of the people were good, for though the land was harsh, the "
"people followed the will of the gods, and thus were vouchsafed enough to "
"live well, and a little more. And the Divines were reverenced as it was "
"written they should be, and all things were in their proper places. \n"
"\n"
"But some there were among the people who decided that a little more than "
"what they needed was not as much as they did want. And in their avarice they "
"fell away from proper reverence, and were taken, yea, body and soul, with "
"the Hunger of Sep. And this was an ill thing, for the Hunger of Sep can "
"never be sated.\n"
"\n"
"Then evil came to Yokuda, and red war, and forbidden rites were practiced, "
"and fell things were summoned that should never have been called forth. It "
"was a Time of Ending. Satakal arose from the starry deeps, and Yokuda was "
"pulled down beneath the waves. \n"
"\n"
"But after every End Time comes a New Time, and it was even so in this case. "
"For some of the people were permitted to sojourn to Tamriel, where we took "
"Hammefell for our own. There we were given a chance to once again worship "
"the gods in proper reverence. And we brought our Samara Scarabs with us, "
"that we might delight the children and remember happier days.\n"
"\n"
"And the Hunger of Sep was left behind—for a time, my child, for a time. But "
"it is deep in our mortal core, and may ever arise again. So the gods gave "
"unto us a warning, yea, even unto the smallest children. For in this New "
"Time, in this New Place, our little companions grew to the size of an ample "
"millet-loaf, as was meet. However, they then continued to grow, and burgeon, "
"and sprout hurtful claws and rending mandibles. And then, with tears, we "
"drove them from our homes and into the wastes, where they flourished and "
"became baneful. \n"
"\n"
"Yes, my child—the Assassin Beetles that plague the empty places are our own "
"Samara Scarabs, smitten by the gods with the Hunger of Sep.  They are a "
"lesson to us, an awful warning to those who would become too avid. \n"
"\n"
"Be happy, then, and forego all avarice—for here we have enough to live well, "
"and a little more."

"A Walker's Guide to Happy Senche-Tigers\n"
"\n"
"by Azmu-ra\n"
"\n"
"The mind of the senche-tiger is like its tail, weaving impossible shapes "
"before pouncing on its prey. If you are that prey, too bad for you! But grab "
"hold of the tail and the senche-tiger does exactly as you want, so long as "
"your grip remains firm.\n"
"\n"
"In theory one could lead a senche-tiger about by its tail forever, but Azmu-"
"ra does not recommend it. Senches are quite fast, very strong, and entirely "
"capable of holding a grudge! Much better to seize the mind, but how to do "
"this?\n"
"\n"
"First understand that, like Khajiit, the senche-tigers have a powerful sweet "
"tooth. They also have fine noses and will track moon-sugar down wherever it "
"hides. In pockets, through walls, in the bellies of close friends—anywhere.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, the senche-tiger's appetite for sugar is only so great. By "
"keeping your senche-tiger on a steady diet, you can manage its more "
"aggressive desires with more useful pursuits, like rat-catching. You need "
"only know how much moon-sugar is enough moon-sugar.\n"
"\n"
"This is where it gets tricky. The senche sweet tooth waxes and wanes with "
"the moons, starting with the phase under which it was born and ending with "
"its lunar opposites. Size is a factor, also, as larger senche require more "
"moon-sugar!\n"
"\n"
"Some trainers can determine a senche-tiger's appetite for moon-sugar by "
"consulting the local Two Moons, but Azmu-ra does not recommend this. A "
"priestess is not always on hand, and keeping both the temple and your senche "
"supplied with moon-sugar is an expensive proposition!\n"
"\n"
"Also, senche-tigers grow swiftly. Unless fully grown, their appetites will "
"change. Many would-be trainers have little time to regret a low stock of "
"moon-sugar! The resulting carnage is never pretty.\n"
"\n"
"Better to keep a stockpile of moon-sugar on hand. The senche eats until "
"sated, and what is left can be used to ice the sweet roll, spice the "
"pudding, or make delectable moon candy.\n"
"\n"
"Once full of moon-sugar, a senche-tiger wants only two things: meat to fill "
"its belly and a sunny place to bask. This makes them suited to guarding "
"fields and hunting game, but this is about all they can do without years of "
"training. Even then, training can only go so far.\n"
"\n"
"For example, motivating senches to pull farming equipment is not recommended."
" If your senche-tiger should deign to endure the harness, it will still be "
"inclined to chase anything larger than a field mouse that it spots across "
"the fields. Save yourself the trouble of collecting scattered plows!\n"
"\n"
"While other trainers have had some success with watch-senche and battle-"
"senche, Azmu-ra would strongly discourage training them to eat people unless "
"you are strong and good at fighting. Even then, this one would not recommend "
"it. A senche-tiger's loyalty reaches only so far as its belly, yes?\n"
"\n"
"Hopefully this guide helped you avoid being eaten by your favorite senche-"
"tiger. If not, well … Azmu-ra made no promises!"

"행복한 센치-호랑이를 위한 보행자의 안내서\n"
"\n"
"아즈무-라 저\n"
"\n"
"센치-호랑이의 마음은 그 꼬리와도 같다. 사냥감을 덮치기 전에 불가능한 모양새로 흔들리는 것이다. 만약 당신이 그 사냥감이라면, 정말로 "
"안 된 일이다! 하지만 그 꼬리를 확 움켜잡으면 센치-호랑이는 정확하게 당신이 원하는 대로 행동할 것이다. 손을 단단히 쥔 채로 있는다면 "
"말이다.\n"
"\n"
"이론적으로는 꼬리를 이용해서 센치-호랑이를 영원히 다룰 수 있다고 하지만, 아즈무-라는 추천하지 않겠다. 센치들은 꽤 빠르고, 아주 "
"강하며, 원한을 고스란히 간직할 수도 있다! 마음을 꽉 움켜잡는 쪽이 훨씬 더 낫다. 하지만 어떻게 해야 할까?\n"
"\n"
"우선 이것을 이해하라. 카짓과 유사하게, 센치-호랑이는 단것을 엄청나게 좋아한다. 또한 좋은 후각을 가지고 있으며 달설탕이 어디에 숨겨져 "
"있건 찾아낼 것이다. 주머니 속에 있건, 벽 너머에 있건, 가까운 친구들의 뱃속에 있건, 어디든지 말이다.\n"
"\n"
"다행스럽게도, 센치-호랑이의 설탕에 대한 욕구는 너무나도 강력하다. 당신의 센치-호랑이에게 규칙적인 식습관을 갖게 하면 더 큰 공격성을 "
"더 유용한 활동에 활용할 수 있다. 쥐잡이 같은 일 말이다. 알아야 할 것은 어느 정도 되는 달설탕이 적당한 양의 달설탕이냐 하는 것 "
"뿐이다.\n"
"\n"
"바로 이것이 까다로운 점이다. 센치들의 단 것에 대한 욕구는 달과 함께 차고 기운다. 달의 위상이 태어날 때 시작되서 달이 반대편을 "
"보여줄 때 끝나는 것이다. 크기 또한 요인이 된다. 더 커다란 센치는 더 많은 달설탕이 필요하다!\n"
"\n"
"몇몇 조련사들은 현지에 있는 두 달의 사원에서 조언을 받아 센치-호랑이의 달설탕에 대한 욕구를 알아낼 수도 있겠지만, 아즈무-라는 이 "
"방법을 추천하지 않는다. 사제들이 항상 도와줄 수 있는 것도 아니고, 사원과 당신의 센치 양쪽 모두에 달설탕을 먹이는 것은 비싼 "
"문제이다!\n"
"\n"
"그리고 센치-호랑이는 빠르게 자란다. 완전히 자라기 전까지는 그 욕구가 변할 것이다. 많은 조련사 지망생들은 달설탕 재고가 줄어드는 것을 "
"슬퍼할 시간이 거의 없다! 그 결과로 생긴 대학살은 절대로 보기 좋지는 않을 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"수중에 있는 달설탕은 비축해 놓는 것이 나을 것이다. 센치들이 질릴 때까지 먹어대고 남은 것들은 스위트 롤에 당의를 입히거나, 푸딩에 "
"곁들이거나, 아주 맛있는 달사탕을 만드는데 사용할 수 있다.\n"
"\n"
"달설탕을 가득 먹고 나면, 센치-호랑이가 원하는 것은 단 두 가지다. 그 배를 채울 고기와 일광욕을 할 햇살이 내리쬐는 장소 말이다. "
"이런 특성은 밭을 지키거나 사냥감을 잡는데 딱 좋지만, 수 년에 걸친 훈련이 없으면 센치가 할 수 있는 일은 이것 뿐일 것이다. 물론 "
"훈련에도 한계는 있다.\n"
"\n"
"예를 들면, 센치에게 농사 기구를 끌게 하는 것은 추천되지 않는다. 당신의 센치-호랑이가 쟁기 끄는 장비를 견뎌내야 하는 수모를 겪는 "
"경우에는 밭에서 발견되는 들쥐보다 더 큰 것을 쫒아가려는 경향을 보일 것이다.박살이 난 쟁기를 주우러 다니는 문제에 휘말리지는 마라!\n"
"\n"
"다른 조련사들이 파수꾼 센치와 전투 센치로 약간의 성공을 거두었지만, 당신이 강하지 않거나 싸움을 잘 못한다면 센치들에게 사람을 먹이는 "
"훈련은 시키지 말 것을 강력하게 권하는 바이다. 당신이 싸움을 잘 한다 해도 추천하지 않겠다. 센치-호랑이의 충성심은 그 배까지만 오지 "
"않는가?\n"
"\n"
"이 안내서가 당신이 가장 좋아하는 센치-호랑이에게 잡아먹히는 것을 피하게 해 주길 바란다. 그렇지 못한다면, 뭐... 아즈무-라가 장담한 "
"적은 없으니까!"

"While the insectoid creatures known as \"\"kwama\"\" originated in "
"Morrowind, do not be surprised to find them elsewhere in Tamriel. The "
"creatures have been transported, intentionally or otherwise, to many "
"different parts of the world.\n"
"\n"
"The barbarous Dunmer, for example, keep the creatures in \"\"egg mines\"\" "
"because they find them a delicacy. \"\"Good eating!\"\" as one toothless old "
"sot told me. I cannot imagine what passes for good food among the Dark Elves "
"that they would eat insect eggs.\n"
"\n"
"But the Dunmer may be on to something, in their own backward way. Kwama are, "
"indeed, excellent miners. They prefer to live underground, creating "
"elaborate tunnel systems as they build their warrens. The creatures consume "
"organic material from the earth and appear to actually excrete minerals they "
"cannot digest, such as gemstones, gold, and iron.\n"
"\n"
"As an experiment, the Aldmeri Dominion is transporting kwama eggs to various "
"outer territories. There, small kwama mines can be established. The kwama "
"can dig to their hearts' content—if they have hearts—and our kwama keepers "
"can pull the minerals from their refuse. Much more efficient than using "
"Argonian captives. The bugs, at least, feed themselves.\n"
"\n"
"There are several different kwama types within the species, and each must be "
"dealt with in a different way.\n"
"\n"
"Kwama scribs are the kwama young and are easily managed. They're voracious "
"but strongly influenced by food. Scribs hatch from long eggs and grow from "
"the size of a large man's foot to the length of a large dog. The scrib may "
"evolve into one of the other types, or it may die.\n"
"\n"
"Kwama foragers explore the outer mine areas and are known to search the "
"surface of the world for new territory. Kwama keepers have learned to "
"\"\"steer\"\" foragers toward potential mine sites and away from Dominion "
"settlements, for kwama undermining can cause sinkholes. It is important for "
"a kwama keeper to know when a forager can't be managed, as the forager must "
"be dispatched before it can return to the mines.\n"
"\n"
"Workers are the most useful of the kwama and will tirelessly dig away, "
"expanding their warrens and searching for food. It is possible for a kwama "
"keeper to use a goad to push workers toward or away from specific sites, but "
"risky. Workers will fight back, and an uprising in a kwama mine is a violent "
"and dangerous event.\n"
"\n"
"A few scribs grow up to become warriors. While some uneducated souls think "
"that killing the warriors keeps the rest in line, this expert disagrees. "
"Killing the warriors causes more scribs to evolve into the mine's protectors "
"and soon you have nothing but the violent creatures to deal with! What's "
"more, the warriors can command lesser kwama, which means an uprising is "
"almost certain. If a warrior must be killed, do it quickly, and away from "
"the rest of the nest!\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the kwama queen. She is a huge, bloated creature, nearly immobile "
"and very rare. Not all hives have queens. Many are just offshoots of greater "
"hives. But all eggs are born of a kwama queen. If one encounters a queen, "
"move away quickly! They are not pleasant creatures and cannot be influenced. "

"Contrary to local myths about the origins of this base species, the dreugh "
"migrate from the Abecean Sea into the lakes and inlets that feed into the "
"Iliac Bay. In addition to their mass of clawlike limbs, pincers, and "
"scuttling feet protruding from a human-torso-sized skeletal frame, the "
"dreugh wear armored hides and secrete shell wax that are prized in some "
"quarters. They are aquatic scavengers, spending much of their time in deep "
"ocean water. Local fishermen tell of altercations with this species (such as "
"when the dreugh cut fishermen's nets to steal fish), but dreugh are mostly "
"mild-mannered, except during karvinasim, their period of transformation.\n"
"\n"
"During karvinasim, dreugh walk upon the land, favoring shoreline marshes and "
"rivers close to the open water. Hatchlings are closely guarded, and "
"broodmothers are extremely territorial, reacting to invaders with both speed "
"and hostility. This leads credence to the notion that karvinasim heightens "
"the dreugh's martial instincts: Indeed, after witnessing the evisceration of "
"our lead geographer Pulcherius Pomptinus, our raiding party thought twice "
"before capturing and culling further specimens.\n"
"\n"
"After a year of land walking, the dreugh return to the water. As they "
"submerge, they undergo a final transformation known as \"\"meff,\"\" where "
"they devour their land skin and air organs—the body parts they no longer "
"need—and then vomit the congealed remains as small fibrous balls that are "
"approximately a foot in diameter. These disgusting and foul-smelling spheres "
"are known as \"\"grom\"\" and are found in clusters around lakes. So far, "

"Nords consider themselves to be the children of the sky. They call Skyrim "

"The breath and the voice are the vital essence of a Nord. When they defeat "

"wedge in front of the gatehouse, and draw in breath. When the leader lets it "
"out in a kiai, the doors are blown in, and the axemen rush into the city. "
"Shouts can be used to sharpen blades or to strike enemies. A common effect "
"is the shout that knocks an enemy back, or the power of command. A strong "
"Nord can instill bravery in men with his battle-cry, or stop a charging "
