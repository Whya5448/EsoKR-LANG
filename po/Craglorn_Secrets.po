"A Scholary Exploration of the Mysterious Fight Club, by Ebidazner Kornod\n"
"\n"
"I have been searching for the elusive and mysterious contest of champions "
"for more years than I care to admit. I first heard of the secret "
"battleground in Valenwood, when Biiri the Beautiful was spoken of as the "
"legendary Champion of the Games. Tried as I might, I could not find the "
"location of these rumored games, nor could I find anyone who had actually "
"seen any of the battles, even though the inns of Valenwood were alive with "
"tales of Biiri's prowess.\n"
"\n"
"After weeks of futile searching, the tales of the Valenwood Arena evaporated "
"as quickly as they started. Somehow, some way, a massive, hidden arena of "
"multiple levels simply vanished. I assumed this was just further proof that "
"the stories were more legend than truth, but still the idea of the place "
"nagged at me. It haunted my dreams and interrupted my thoughts at the oddest "
"moments.\n"
"\n"
"When next I heard rumors of a mysterious and secret Arena, I was in Windhelm "
"for the Skald-King's Konunleikar. In the shadows of the dingy mead halls, "
"rough and tumble Nords described a magical battlegrounds where the "
"environment changed with every match. To earn a victory meant getting to "
"fight another match. To find defeat was to experience a bloody and violent "
"death. It sounded gruesome and fascinating to me, and the Nords drank it up "
"like it was the sweetest beverage they ever tasted.\n"
"\n"
"The place was called the Skyrim Arena, but I was never able to locate an "
"entrance to the battlegrounds. This time they spoke of the glorious "
"victories of Holgstad the Horrible. He was supposedly a Nord's Nord. Tall as "
"a troll and twice as powerful, Holgstad was rumored to enter each match "
"carrying a double-bladed axe and a dagger that sparked with lightning. They "
"said he had a trio of Nord shield maidens that fought by his side, and that "
"they were destroying the competition in match after match—much to the "
"approval of the Arena's mysterious patron.\n"
"\n"
"I think I was getting close to finding the secret location when suddenly the "
"stories stopped. It happened again. This supposedly ancient arena of stone "
"and metal had disappeared as quickly as it had arrived, taking Holgstad and "
"his shield maidens with it. The Nords cheered, drank to their honored "
"champion, and then went back to dealing with the more mundane happenings of "
"the realm.\n"
"\n"
"I dispaired of ever getting that close to the Arena again when I happened to "
"be traveling on one of the Dragonstar Caravan Company's wagons. One of the "
"caravan guards was bragging about how he was going to compete in the "
"Dragonstar Arena when he returned to Craglorn after this run. He knew he was "
"strong enough to challenge the current champion. All he had to do was "
"convince three of his fellow guards to join him so he had a proper team.\n"
"\n"
"Over drinks around the evening fire, I was able to learn as much as the "
"guard could tell me about the Arena. He explained that it was an ancient "
"ruin that suddenly appeared in the hills behind the town of Dragonstar a few "
"weeks back. Challengers were arriving from all over Craglorn and beyond to "
"compete in the secret games. They had even set up a makeshift camp outside "
"the Arena entrance. I knew this was the Arena I had been searching for, that "
"somehow it changed locations whenever the competition began to falter. That "
"it was capable of moving—stone by stone—across the world.\n"
"\n"
"Now I'm inside the Arena, hoping to gain access to the games themselves. I "
"need to see how the environments change. I need to determine if it's some "
"amazing feat of ancient engineering or some sort of magic that makes the "
"impossible happen for every match. And I need to determine who the "
"mysterious patron of the Arena actually is. I have suspicions, of course, "
"but I'm sure the truth will turn out to be exceedingly stranger than "
"anything I can imagine."

"Oh, Papa, the wonders I've seen! I know we exchanged harsh words when you "
"decided to send me to Craglorn, but you were right. The experience has done "
"me a world of good. Of course, I've had to put up with more than my share of "
"milk-drinkers and horkers, but that's to be expected whenever we venture far "
"from the borders of our beloved Skyrim. But let me tell you about the "
"experiences I've had.\n"
"\n"
"First, they say the stars have fallen from the sky and walk like men in this "
"wasteland. I don't know about that, but I saw warriors of sand and dust rise "
"from the battlefield like ancient specters. They were tough, but nothing "
"that honest Nord steel couldn't take down.\n"
"\n"
"Then I ran into these strange monstrosities that seemed to be a mix of "
"various creatures. It was almost as though a scorpion and a wamasu had a "
"baby—and yes, it was as amazing and terrible as that sounds. The locals "
"called it a \"\"mantikora.\"\" I called it ugly and hit it with my axe. A "
"lot.\n"
"\n"
"And did I mention the cultists in my last letter? Yes, Craglorn has them, "
"too. But these cultists are special. Call themselves the Scaled Court and "
"give themselves high-and-mighty titles such as \"\"regents\"\" and "
"\"\"exarchs.\"\" What a bunch of horkers! And would you believe it? They "
"worship some kind of sky snake! Of all the possible deities to choose from, "
"they decided that a creature that wiggles around on its belly was the end "
"all and be all. I hit them with my axe. A lot. And it felt good!\n"
"\n"
"Now I'm enjoying a mead and preparing to enter the Dragonstar Arena. You'd "
"be so proud of me, Papa! I've gathered a decent group of warriors and I "
"think we have a chance to win this competition. Who knew a Nord, a Dark Elf, "
"and two Argonians would make such a good team? I haven't been able to get "
"all the details on what we'll be up against, but I figure it can't be much "
"harder than the Konunleikar games. I'll write again after we win the trophy. "
"Or whatever it is we win.\n"

"\n"
"I continue my commentary on my exploration of Skyreach Pinnacle while "
"Reginus lounges around back at the base camp, nursing an injured ankle and "
"cursing his bad run of luck on this expedition. But now that I think about "
"it, maybe he was just getting tired of crawling around in dusty, old ruins "
"and decided he needed a break. I wouldn't put it past him to have me do all "
"of the work around here.\n"
"\n"
"I've reached the main chamber of this portion of the ruins. It was obviously "
"a ceremonial room of some sort, perhaps associated with the Nedic religion "
"or arcane practices. Four summoning circles or ritual stones of some sort "
"occupy key positions around the room. I'm not an expert on arcane rituals by "
"any means, but I wouldn't be surprised if these stone platforms were wards "
"of some sort. I'll make etchings of the stones and see what Reginus thinks "
"they represent.\n"
"\n"
"The center of the chamber appears to be decorated with an engraved ritual "
"circle that seems to depict an alien visage of some kind. Is it another of "
"the supposed Nedic gods that we have yet to fully identify? I'll put that it "
"the definite \"\"maybe\"\" category. I do get a sense of foreboding in this "
"ancient space, as though something of great consequence took place here. I "
"wish I could find a text or something that would just explain everything to "
"me, but then I guess I'd have no work to do for the university, would I?\n"
"\n"
"The raised platform at the far end of the chamber contains two interesting "
"and noteworthy features. First, a fifth summoning circle (ward stone?) is "
"embedded in the floor of the platform. Second, a huge opening in the wall "
"provides a view into the night sky. Could this have been an astronomical "
"tool of some sort? Does a particular pattern of stars appear in this portion "
"of the sky on a given day? I'll need to see how I can research that avenue "

"\n"
"I hope this letter finds you as strong and as intimidating to our enemies as "
"they day we met.\n"
"\n"
"I have studied the process you utilize to imbue your magnificent armor and "
"your spectacular body decorations with nirncrux dust, and I applaud your "
"ingenuity and craftsmanship. I truly am in awe at what you have accomplished."
"\n"
"\n"
"First, Ilthag Ironblood is a master tactician and a remarkable trainer. How "
"he accomplishes this never ceases to amaze me, and I have tried to replicate "
"his process to no avail. I never imagined that trolls and welwas could be "
"turned into servants and soldiers. Adding their power to our forces makes "
"the Scaled Court undefeatable!\n"
"\n"
"Your talented armorer has crafted armor that is lighter, stronger, and "
"literally glowing with nirncrux power. A remarkable achievement that we "
"never would have been able to match without her skill and expertise. Not "
"only was it a stroke of brillance to then equip trained trolls and welwas "
"with the infused armor, but as production increases I look forward to "
"equiping all of our forces with the special armor.\n"
"\n"
"The artistry demonstrated by your runescriber sends tingles up my spine. His "
"designs are hypnotic, and I could swear they seem to move as I try to study "
"the intricate patterns. By adding nirncrux dust to the ink and brands, the "
"magic he imbues in his subjects increases a hundredfold. Remarkable! "
"Combined, the training, the armor, and the body runes make the trolls nearly "
"unstoppable.\n"
"\n"
"If I may, allow me to offer a final ritual that you can employ to make the "
"nearly unstoppable into the virtually invincible. Try it on one of your "
"trolls and let me know if the results are everything I promise.\n"

"From the journal of Ilthag Ironblood.\n"
"\n"
"I am known for many skills and achievements, for my battle prowess and "
"talents related to training Iron Orcs and other creatures to fight. But "
"here, in my private journal, I have a confession to make to the rock and "
"stone. I take pride in a secret passion. I take pride in raising my beloved "
"welwas, Vosh and Rakh, from cute and cuddly cubs into the loyal and "
"ferocious beasts they are today.\n"
"\n"
"I acquired the cubs when I was forced to kill an adult welwa in the barrens "
"near the ruins of ancient Skyreach. After dispatching the savage beast, I "
"discovered the cubs in a nearby cave. I almost killed the young creatures "
"then and there, but one of them looked into my eyes and cooed. Then it rose "
"up on shaky legs and rubbed against my leather boot. That's when another "
"option presented itself to me.\n"
"\n"
"I took the two welwa infants back to my undertower. My original idea was to "
"raise the beasts for use in my training exercises. But as I worked with them "
"and discovered their natural intelligence and their warrior hearts, I "
"decided to raise them as my personal guards and companions. To begin the "
"process, I needed to discover their true names.\n"
"\n"
"I worked with the young creatures for a time, getting familiar with their "
"personalities as they became accustomed to my presence. The one that first "
"looked at me was full of courage. He wasn't afraid to venture out and "
"explore his surroundings. He showed me his name—Vosh. The other was quiet, "
"calm. At least until one of my aides approached. Then he became a ball of "
"anger, striking out like a sword to protect me and his brother. Obviously, "
"his name was Rakh.\n"
"\n"
"As they grew in size, I made sure they grew in power. I constantly ran them "
"throughout the undertower to build muscle and bone. I fed them the best food "
"and clearest water drawn from the purest rock wells in the region. I devised "
"exercises using thick ropes and handles. When they reached the appropriate "
"size, I began to train them to fight beside me against multiple enemies. "
"When Rakh took down one of my most skilled warriors, I was so proud!\n"
"\n"
"Recently, I had Uthik fashion a set of armor for both Vosh and Rakh. They "
"seemed so honored to receive the gifts, and they carry themselves with "
"dignity and grace inside their metal protection. Next, I might see if they "
"can work together to take down a troll on their own. That would be an "
"amazing sight to see, by the stones!"

"\n"
"Reginus needed a rest and some juniper tea, so I've taken up ink and quill "
"to continue the record of our exploration of Skyreach Hold. (I love how he "
"hates that I have a more friendly and exciting writing style than he does! "
"Smashing!)\n"
"\n"
"I'm coming more and more to the certainty that the Nedes possessed an "
"advanced society. Perhaps even more advanced than our own in certain ways. "
"The engineering skills that were required to construct these massive spaces "
"within the mountain are almost too much to fathom. I'm not sure if our best "
"engineers and crafters wouldn't be hard-pressed to duplicate the effort. The "
"intricate gardens, the vaulted ceilings, the ingenious waterways and "
"fountains—it all points to a level of sophistication and aesthetic that "
"rivals or exceeds the best Cyrodiil has to offer.\n"
"\n"
"I think that the overall skill and craftsmanship demonstrated in the "
"stonework that surrounds us clearly shows that the Nedes were much more than "
"war-loving savages. I'm sorry, Reginus, but I have to record it as I see it. "
"The architecture demonstrates that they treated stonework and masonry as an "
"art form. The carvings are more than simple decoration. They tell a story of "
"a proud and powerful people, of a culture reaching for the stars that was "
"then cut short by jealous invaders. Even in ruins, there is a grandeur here "
"that leaves me breathless.\n"
"\n"
"Even more impressive are the spaces that are open to the sky. These open "
"ceilings let in fresh air and sunshine, and were perfect for observing the "
"night sky—a practice we know the Nedes were fond of thanks to ancient texts "
"and tablets such as the Perenaal Fragment and others. I believe that the "
"Nedic obsession with the stars isn't simply because they worshiped or had "
"some other deep connection to the Celestials. I believe that the Nedes were "
"somehow involved in the very creation of the whole concept of the Celestials."
" I plan to find proof of this during our explorations of this space and the "
"neighboring ruins.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, Reginus strongly disagrees with my proposition. He even demands "
"that I return the quill to him. Historian, indeed! He wouldn't know a fact "
"from a fantasy if it walked up and said \"\"hello.\"\" Oh, very well. My "
"hand was beginning to cramp, anyway."

"Today we made our first foray into the undercroft known as Skyreach "
"Catacombs. It is evident that the dead of the Nedic city were interred "
"within this vast labyrinth. However, we have not yet been able to determine "
"if all classes of citizens were allowed to make use of these facilities, or "
"if it was just a place for the rich and powerful. We will begin examining a "
"sampling of the graves at once. Who knows what relics we might find buried "
"with each Nedic corpse?\n"
"\n"
"Some of the guards and workers in our party have begun to complain about "
"this place. They say these catacombs are haunted. One of my students "
"actually reminded me of the legend of Virmaril the Betrayer. I usually don't "
"hold with such nonsense, but I must admit that a feeling of dread has "
"settled over me. And like some of the others, I imagine I'm hearing a voice "
"whose words are spoken just low enough that I can't make them out. Perhaps "
"we're just frightening each other with these wild tales. Still, the faster "
"we complete our study, the faster we can exit this dismal place.\n"
"\n"
"(I've taken up the quill again, as Reginus appears to be almost frozen with "
"fear at the moment. We haven't actually seen any spirits or walking dead "
"yet, but more and more of our crew are complaining about the strange voices "
"in their heads. I'm going to ignore them for the moment and talk about the "
"amazing chamber we just came across. This must have been where the legendary "
"meeting of the Nedic kings took place! Each of the kings appear as they must "
"have looked in their last moments of life, sitting in their thrones as if "
"about to enter into a grand debate. —Verita N.)\n"
"\n"
"I don't know what came over me, but I have shaken off the feeling of doom "
"and retrieved my quill from our fanciful Verita. I must document the "
"position of each of these ancient kings so that our record of this discovery "
"is complete. Though their names have been lost to history, we know the "
"titles of each of the kings spread out around the High King Durac. They "
"include such luminaries as the Forest King, the Spirit King, and the Frost "
"King. We don't know why they carried these titles, but I'm sure it had "
"something to do with the region of the Nedic realm they ruled. Or perhaps it "
"had something to do with their own personal portfolios of power.\n"
"\n"
"(Give me that quill! Who cares what they were called. I think this chamber "
"demonstrates the true state of Virmaril the Betrayer's mind. I don't think "
"he was trying to raise an undead army. I think he was more of a collector. I "
"think this place is now his collection! It makes a certain amount of sense "
"if you look at the evidence before us. —Verita N.)\n"
"\n"
"Nonsense! Virmaril is nothing more than a legend. And ghost stories do "
"nothing to advance the cause of knowledge and history. Let's move on before "
"we all succumb to these imaginary voices."

"As we saw in the other parts of the city we have already explored, the same "
"odd figures appear throughout the Nedic architecture. Clearly, a serpentine "
"motif is depicted everywhere. I contend that this is proof positive that the "
"Nedes worshiped some sort of serpent god and were so enamored of this deity "
"that they wanted to see him wherever they looked.\n"
"\n"
"Verita says my theory has merit, and I thank her for that. But she insists "
"on offering an alternate opinion. She says it's to make sure all avenues of "
"possibility are explored, but I contend she just wants to be contrary. She "
"does enjoy disagreeing with me at every chance she gets. Her theory is that "
"the snake was simply a popular figure in Nedic culture, not unlike the "
"Friendly Netch, the Brave Little Squib, or the Gift-Giving Guar of our own "
"popular legends.\n"
"\n"
"We must agree to disagree, as the other popular saying goes.\n"
"\n"
"Other images we have spotted over and over again in the stonework include an "
"odd, Orcish face, a stag-skull sort of creature, and a winged serpent, which "
"could be related to the other snake images. Gods? Popular story characters? "
"Simple decorative elements without higher meaning? I believe we are looking "
"upon the Nedic pantheon, for I can't imagine going to all this trouble just "
"to depict imaginary creatures from camp-fire tales.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"We now believe that the catacombs were originally used as the city of "
"Skyreach's graveyard. We have found evidence that the interred came from all "
"walks of life, from commoners to crafters, nobles to royals. We have also "
"developed conflicting theories about why the confines of these catacombs "
"have disturbed us so profoundly.\n"
"\n"
"I believe that it is shared illusion, given substance by lingering legends "
"and fueled by our own fears. We just need to rely on our intellects and "
"strength of will, then everything will be fine. Besides, illusions cannot "
"hurt us. Of that, I am fairly certain.\n"
"\n"
"Verita, of course, has a differing opinion. She believes that the legends "
"concerning Virmaril the Betrayer, who we know of only through the remains of "
"a text now called the Perenaal Fragment, have at least a grain of truth to "
"them. It is her belief that Virmaril was indeed a necromancer, and that "
"somehow he has defied the laws of nature and still exists in one form or "
"another somewhere deep within this labyrinth. I say balderdash, but as I "
"agreed to let her join this expedition, I feel somewhat obligated to allow "
"her to express her theories—no matter how outlandish they may be.\n"
"\n"
"It is Verita's contention that Virmaril has been asleep these long aeons, "
"and we have somehow begun the process of awakening him from his eternal "
"slumber. Just to be on the safe side, we have decided to cut our exploration "
"of the catacombs short and move on to the next site in the complex. Perhaps "
"we shall return to these ruins at a later time, after our heads have cleared."

"\n"
"With an equal measure of excitement and trepidation, I begin this series of "
"journals that will one day form the basis of a scholarly work on Skyreach "
"and the ancient Nedic people. The University of Gwylim has generously funded "
"this expedition, in exchange for the exclusive rights to publish at least "
"two books related to the subject at hand.\n"
"\n"
"Note, however, that these journals are not the finished, published work. "
"They contain my observations, theories, and general musings on everything I "
"encounter throughout this trip. The journals will also contain asides by my "
"scholarly partner, Verita Numida, whose theories are usually wildly opposite "
"of anything I propose. I like to think that our differing points of view "
"help to create a more complete picture of the past, but I will admit here, "
"within these pages, that she often drives me into an intellectual rage. "
"Without her support and the addition of her lofty credentials alongside my "
"own, however, I'm not sure this expedition would have come to fruition.\n"
"\n"
"Why Skyreach? These ancient ruins, we believe, hold the answers to the "
"question that has intrigued us both since we first started looking into "
"Cyrodiil's past. Namely, who were the ancient Nedes, the people who "
"eventually gave rise to the mighty Imperials? I always imagined them to be "
"uncivilized brutes that were as likely to fight each other as they were "
"their enemies, but Verita has constantly insisted that they had to have a "
"more advanced culture than I gave them credit for. Perhaps deep within the "
"ruins of Skyreach, we will settle our argument once and for all.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Remarkable! The city of Skyreach appears to extend not only around the "
"Dragontail Mountains, but through them and even beneath them. What an "
"amazing feat of engineering went into the crafting of the place. It appears "
"I have lost at least one argument with Verita. The ancient Nedes were "
"certainly not simply uncivilized brutes. But beyond that, these monoliths "
"have yet to tell us exactly who they were.\n"
"\n"
"We have begun our investigation in a section of the ruined city we have "
"decided to call \"\"The Hold.\"\" Our first goal is to explore the area and "
"come to some conclusions about what daily life must have been like in this "
"Nedic metropolis. Did they utilize both the exterior and interior spaces, or "
"were they primarily dwelling within the space carved from the very heart of "
"the mountain? Perhaps the intricate carvings will provide some clue. \n"
"\n"
"On first inspection, I theorize that the Nedes built this massive living "
"structure as a private estate for one of their vaunted High Kings. Perhaps "
"it was even the final residence of Durac, the High King that presided over "
"the fall of the Nedes.\n"
"\n"
"Verita, as usual, disagrees. She posits that the commonfolk lived and worked "
"both inside and outside these now-ruined buildings. The evidence we see for "
"what appear to be areas converted into living spaces, she claims, lend "
"credence to the theory that the Nedes retreated into the mountain as a "
"result of the Yokudan invasion. Her theory may be more sound, on further "
"consideration, but I am not yet ready to concede to her on this. Not yet."

"\n"
"My father and Virmaril spent another day and most of the night in the "
"catacombs beneath Skyreach. They share a fascination for the dark arts, but "
"sometimes I wonder if their friendship isn't too complicated. Father bears "
"such a burden as the Nedic High King, and I fear that every time he asks "
"Virmaril for advice he passes a bit of that burden onto my beloved.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"We haven't told father of our love as yet, but Virmaril assures me that he "

"Father was furious. Despite his long friendship with Virmaril, he wasn't at "
"all happy with the idea of his beloved daughter marrying a High Elf. I'm "
"heartbroken over this, but I must remain strong. I am the High King's "
"daughter, after all, and I have a duty to my father and my people. No matter "
"how much this outcome pains me. And poor Virmaril. I've never seen him look "
"so … shattered.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I'm going to marry King Kestic. Father arranged the marriage to help "
"strengthen ties with Kestic and the northern clans. I still have powerful "
"feelings for Virmaril, but I have to put them behind me. Our love is "
"forbidden, and this marriage will make the Nedic clans stronger. I wonder if "
"Virmaril has moved on with his own life yet?\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"The barbaric Yokudans gather at our doors. I saw Virmaril and father "
"together today. They both seemed worried. Oh, they try not to let it show, "
"but I know them both so well. Virmaril says he has a plan to repel the "
"invaders. He thinks father will support the idea. They just need to convince "
"the other Nedic kings.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Virmaril was watching me throughout tonight's feast. There was a … hunger … "
"in his eyes that I hadn't seen before. Perhaps I'm imagining things, but I "
"could swear that Virmaril had no thoughts about invaders or armies or wars "
"this night. He only had eyes for me.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Virmaril came to me in the royal chambers. I was hesitant to talk to him at "
"first, but I didn't want to seem distant. He told me that he still loved me. "
"Asked me to run away with him. I laughed at the idea, assuming he was joking."
" But I could see in his eyes, his feelings for me were as strong as ever. I "
"turned away before my own emotions betrayed me.\n"
"\n"

"Virmaril was cold today, distant. When I asked if he was well, he just said "

"By Mendan Flot,\n"
"Regent of Roiling Concoctions\n"
"\n"
"What a remarkable substance the Scaled Court has discovered! Or perhaps I "
"should say, \"\"rediscovered.\"\" For it is true that the ancient Nedes made "
"use of this primordial element in ages past. They even appear to have known "
"about its unique properties, including its ability to absorb and distribute "
"Aetherial energy. But I feel confident in my claims that even the Nedes "
"never achieved the variety of uses we have discovered for the element we "
"call \"\"nirncrux.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"When the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems emerged from the ruins of Skyreach "
"and gave us the gift of nirncrux, we were equal parts excited and confused "
"as to what to do with the primordial element. But the Serpent whispered to "
"the regent, and she in turn described several ways we could immediately "
"utilize the substance to increase the power of the Scaled Court. But simple "
"tricks and minor boosts were just the beginning. The Regent of Serpentine "
"Stratagems had greater plans than these, and she ordered me and my "
"alchemists to increase the application of the element a hundredfold.\n"
"\n"
"My alchemists first studied the viability of the element in its natural, "
"solid form. The substance can be found as veins running through denser rock "
"throughout the upper region of Craglorn, and sometimes as grains or nuggets "
"along river beds or at the base of hills and mountains. In its solid form, "
"nirncrux is brittle and flaky. It resists attacks by most acids, and does "
"not tarnish when exposed to air or water. However, it is neither dense "
"enough nor strong enough for use in practical applications, such as forging "
"weapons or crafting armor.\n"
"\n"
"When ground into a powder or dust, the true worth of nirncrux comes to light."
" The energy stored within the individual grains of dust can be released "
"using an ancient Nedic ritual that we have modified to better serve the "
"Serpent, and the energized nirncrux dust can be utilized in potions, "
"elixirs, and other concoctions.\n"
"\n"
"For example, preliminary tests suggest that the dust can be incorporated "
"into the ink used by the Iron Orcs to create their intricate, power-focusing "
"tattoos. Imagine decorating creatures such as trolls and welwas with these "
"ritualistic tattoos. Can they be made into even more powerful engines of "
"destruction? We believe the answer is a resounding \"\"yes.\"\" We've "
"already provided the newly named Ophidian Exarch of Undulating "
"Destruction—otherwise known as the Iron Orc chieftain, Braadoth—with enough "
"of the nirncrux dust to enhance ink to decorate nearly one hundred of the "
"wild creatures. And more of the primordial element is being gathered for "
"processing even as I write these words.\n"
"\n"
"Another immediate application for the dust is being spearheaded by the "
"Regent of Wriggling Nightmares and his team. It involves ancient spawning "
"pools and a variety of exotic and dangerous creatures. By mixing the "
"nirncrux dust with the primeval, procreative nature of the pools, he hopes "
"to create an entirely new monster to add to the Serpent's growing arsenal. I "
"will be interested to see how his theories come to fruition.\n"
"\n"
"A promising avenue to explore involves another state of the element. We "
"believe that the molten form of the substance might provide an even greater "
"release of Aetherial power. Ancient Nedic writing that we discovered "
"suggests that whatever processes these lost people once used to either "
"create or enhance celestial creatures required the molten form of the "
"substance. We are building great crucibles to smelt the substance into a "
"liquid state.\n"
" \n"
"Why the substance only appears in Upper Craglorn remains a mystery, though "
"my alchemists have formed a number of theories to explain it. The leading "
"candidate suggests that the substance was deposited in the region in the "
"distant past by chunks of rock that fell from the sky. Another possibility "
"indicates that the Nedes may have used arcane rituals to draw the substance "
"up from deep within the core of the world, as hinted at in a few wall "
"decorations we examined in Skyreach's ruins.\n"
"\n"
"We may never fully understand where this primordial element came from or "
"what it truly is, but that will not stop us from using it for the glory and "
"grand purpose of the Serpent and his mortal limbs, the Regent of Serpentine "
"Stratagems."

"A Report Prepared for the Star-Gazers\n"
"By Valinka Stoneheaver\n"
"\n"
"I finally got a chance to use one of the simple tricks my mentor—the famed "
"explorer and adventurer, Narsis Dren—taught me. Turns out, if you dress in "
"the same outfit as the people around you, keep your head low, and act like "
"you belong, you can infiltrate even one of the most evil and dastardly cults "
"currently operating in Craglorn. Even so, it wasn't easy. And I felt for "
"sure that I was going to be revealed as a spy every moment I was there. But "
"I snuck inside and emerged again to tell the tale. Barely! So, let me tell "
"you about life in the Scaled Court—at least, life as I saw it for about four "
"hours last Middas.\n"
"\n"
"For the most part, life in the Scaled Court camp was much like what you'd "
"expect in any gathering of rough-and-tumble fighters and mages. There was "
"the usual good-natured banter among people who lived, worked, and fought "
"side-by-side. There were a number of harsher words exchanged, too, showing "
"that not everyone in the cult always gets along. But they had a singularity "
"of purpose. The members of the Scaled Court that I interacted with were "
"dedicated to their leaders, their god, and their cause. It was scary, how "
"devoted to the Serpent these men and women seemed to be.\n"
"\n"
"One young man, a former bandit from Rivenspire, was particularly enamored "
"with the leaders of the Scaled Court. He seemed to be particularly intrigued "
"by the highfalutin (in my opinion) and grandiose titles and affectations the "
"leaders assigned to themselves. It starts at the very top, with the council "
"of regents who apparently control the organization. I never got to meet any "
"of the regents, but most were spoken of with admiration and awe. I believe "
"that some of them hold positions in the hearts of the Scaled Court almost as "
"revered as the Celestial Serpent himself. \n"
"\n"
"There seemed to be some disagreement as to the wisdom of making the Iron Orc "
"chieftain the Ophidian Exarch of Undulating Destruction. No one could fault "
"that the addition of the Iron Orcs to the Scaled Court's ranks was an "
"inspired idea, but instituting the brutish Braadoth into the highest "
"echelons of the Serpent's forces in Upper Craglorn was not sitting well with "
"everyone in camp. I gathered this opinion in fits and starts, by "
"interpreting asides and whispers, and pressing the most upset members for "
"whatever additional information they were willing to share. Even so, no one "
"I met wanted to challenge the Ophidian Exarch or the other regents, so the "
"Orc chieftain's promotion stands.\n"
"\n"
"Other leadership positions in the Scaled Court include the Regent of "
"Wriggling Nightmares (who seems to be involved in crafting monsters loyal to "
"the Serpent), the Regent of Fanged Fury, the Vizier of Slithering Visions, "
"and a woman named Cassipia, who they called the Regent of Serpentine "
"Stratagems. An entirely different chain of command was in place in Lower "
"Craglorn. I never encountered any of these pompously titled individuals. And "
"that's probably a good thing, as I'm not sure my disguise would have fooled "
"them.\n"
"\n"
"I spent the rest of my time in the camp wandering around and listening to "
"conversations, watching men and women perform the multitude of mundane tasks "
"that fill the day at any military camp. (And make no mistake—the Scaled "
"Court is as military an organization as any I've ever encountered!) I heard "
"mention of some unidentified substance that seemed important to the Scaled "
"Court, but I could never determine exactly what it was. Perhaps someone in "
"the Star-Gazers has heard of it. They referred to it as \"\"nirncrux dust."
"\"\" Whatever the substance is used for, the Scaled Court seems to consider "
"it vital to their plans.\n"
"\n"
"During my final hour in the camp, I began to get the distinct impression "
"that I was being watched. Immediately alert, I scanned the area for any sign "
"that I had been recognized as the outsider I was. However, no one was "
"raising an alert. No one was rushing toward me. But the feeling persisted, "
"and I decided I had overstayed my welcome. I started to disengage from the "
"group and slowly make my way to the edge of the camp when a band of Iron "
"Orcs wandered in. If the sight of them made my blood run cold, my first view "
"of the armored troll that accompanied them froze the blood in my veins.\n"
"\n"
"The troll wore strange armor of Orcish design, run through with glyphs that "
"made me want to look away (although maybe that was just the fear the "
"creature inspired in me). I could have sworn it turned to study me, but then "
"it was pulled along by its Orc masters and I had a clear path out of the "
"camp. Before I reached the freedom I so desperately desired, however, I felt "
"a hand gently grip my shoulder. I tensed, let out a few deep breaths to "
"steady my nerves, and turned to face whoever had found me out.\n"
"\n"
"I was looking at a young Wood Elf with piercing eyes. She smiled, not "
"unkindly, and handed me a folded piece of paper. \"\"You're nice,\"\" she "
"said. Then she turned away, leaving me to depart without further incident. I "
"must have walked for an hour or more before I finally slowed and rested my "
"weary back against a large, cool boulder. I sank to the ground and unfolded "
"the piece of paper . It contained five short words.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Tell them what you saw.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I dropped the paper and ran, sure that the howling hordes of the Scaled "
"Court were chasing on my heels. But I made it back to Belkarth without any "
"problems and wrote this report while it was still fresh in my mind. So "
"fresh, in fact, that I'll probably have nightmares."

"By Valinka Stoneheaver\n"
"\n"
"In my capacity as a collector of objects, a delver of dungeons, and an "
"explorer of (soon-to-be) renown, I often take on commissions to obtain "
"specific items or information. The Star-Gazers of Craglorn hired me to find "
"out everything I could pertaining to the recently formed group known as the "
"Scaled Court.\n"
"\n"
"The Scaled Court seemed to appear out of nowhere, popping up all across "
"Craglorn in the wake of the mysterious disappearances of the Celestial "
"Guardians from the night sky. With a little digging and the judicial "
"application of free drinks and similar bribes, I was able to ascertain that "
"prior to arriving in Craglorn, the group had been a loose association of "
"mercenaries on their way to battle in Cyrodiil. \n"
"\n"
"Originally led by the Nord warlord, Milvern One-Sword, the mercenaries "
"entered the region with the intent of offering their services to whichever "
"army was willing to pay a hefty price in gold and spoils. But they were "
"rebuked and turned away by the Cyrodiil generals, who refused to leave their "
"fighting to hired thugs. The unemployed mercenaries roamed the Craglorn "
"wilderness for a time as One-Sword struggled to come up with another plan to "
"keep his band together. While camped in the wasteland southeast of "
"Dragonstar, a lone figure wandered into view of the disheartened group. \n"
"\n"
"She had the regal bearing of an Imperial and a confidence that allowed for "
"no opposition. \"\"I bring a message from He Who Has No Season,\"\" she "
"proclaimed in a loud, commanding voice. \"\"You are aimless wanderers in who "
"the Serpent sees kindred spirits. Join me and the Serpent will reward you a "
"thousandfold!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Of course, Milvern One-Sword took umbrage with this stranger trying to turn "
"his band against him. As he drew his blade and approached her, she smiled "
"calmly and whispered, \"\"Serpent, protect your servant.\"\" Suddenly, the "
"ghostly visage of a great snake surrounded the woman. She pointed, and the "
"ghostly snake uncoiled and struck like lightning, piercing Milvern's armor "
"with two sharp, venom-dripping fangs. He was dead before his body hit the "
"ground.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The Celestial Serpent has sent me to gather you,\"\" the woman "
"proclaimed, \"\"to give you purpose and glory and power beyond your "
"imagining! I am the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems, and together we are the "
"Scaled Court!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And that, as far as I can determine, is how the Scaled Court came to "
"Craglorn."

"\n"
"Cassipia, she who wields the title of Regent of Serpentine Stratagems of the "
"Scaled Court, sees twelve steps ahead at all times. She carries "
"contingencies and alternate plans with her the way a warrior carries "
"multiple weapons, ready to pull out the right tool for whatever situation "

"what to think! Maybe if I write down what I know, my path will become "
"clearer to me.\n"
"\n"
"While I am loathe to commit the entirety of Cassipia's actions to paper, as "
"I don't want to inaccurately portray her complex thoughts, what I've seen "
"and heard must be recorded. I don't want her enemies to twist the truth and "
"paint her as some sort of Serpent-hating villain. The world needs to see "
"Cassipia's brilliance for what it really is, as bright and piercing as a "
"million stars, as opposed to the poor light in which she could possibly be "
"bathed.\n"
"\n"
"It was Cassipia who first noticed the connection between the primordial "
"element our alchemists call nirncrux and the celestial energy of Aetherius. "
"The idea to use the element to enhance the work of the Iron Orcs came to "
"Cassipia almost immediately. And the stroke of genius to use it to create a "
"new creature—that came to her in a moment of pure inspiration worthy of the "
"Serpent himself.\n"
"\n"
"But then, when she saw how her work was being used at the Serpent's behest, "
"my friend and mistress became increasingly enraged. She loved the creation "
"of the mantikora, for example, but she hated that it was being turned into "
"nothing but an engine of destruction. She appreciated the skill the Iron "
"Orcs demonstrated with their metallurgy and alchemy, but she detested that "
"such wonderful gear was being wasted on common trolls and welwas.\n"
"\n"
"Suffice it to say, Cassipia has turned against the Serpent, and I don't know "
"how to reconcile that fact. She says she will lead the Scaled Court to a "
"greatness the likes of which this world has never seen, but how can she "
"accomplish this without the Serpent's blessing? I want to believe her, to "
"trust in the woman I love and know. But can I also turn away from the "
"Serpent's coiled embrace?\n"
"\n"
"Cassipia is the Regent of Serpentine Stratagems, and I am barely worthy to "

"hopes to use the stable nirncrux to elevate her power. But everything feels "

"can't hold these thoughts to myself any longer. If I try, I fear my head "

"Stratagems and leader of the Scaled Court's forces in Upper Craglorn.\n"
"\n"
"My name is Little Leaf, and I have served my mistress since before we joined "
"the Scaled Court. I met Cassipia in Auridon, where she was a high-ranking "
"member of the Mages Guild. She noticed me admiring her power and grace from "
"afar, and she personally selected me to wait upon her every need. Since "
"then, I have become her confidant and confessor, giving her a sounding board "
"for her most intimate thoughts and musings. No one knows Cassipia better "
"than I do, or believes in her the way I do—with all my heart and soul. \n"
"\n"
"How can I say such things when the Serpent is our lord and master? Oh, I "

"Who did as the Serpent asked and brought the Iron Orcs into our fold? "
"Cassipia, of course. She follows the Serpent's orders, but always looks for "

"\n"
"But before you think me just an infatuated fool with her head in the clouds, "
"let me tell you why Cassipia has risen so high within our ranks. Cassipia is "

"Scaled Court—not like those bumbling fools that brought us the unfortunate "
"setbacks we've suffered in Lower Craglorn! Regent Cassipia was busy in Upper "
"Craglorn while the Serpent's \"\"select\"\" were losing their hold on the "

"\n"
"\"\"The People were greatly disturbed by this and fell to their knees "

"\n"
"\"\"That night, Orsa prayed to the stars saying, 'Oh stars, what shall I do? "

"\n"
"\"\"The stars spoke back, saying, 'Orsa. Why do you cry for the People? Do "

"One day the children of the People came to Abba Arl and asked, \"\"Who are "
"our parents?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Abba Arl replied, \"\"The People have not two parents but four, and they are "
"as follows. The great Dragon of Time, who set the stars in their courses and "
"appointed the guardians to watch over the world. The Mother Serpent in the "
"curve of whose back the world rests. The Fat Mother who nourished the People "
"when they were lost and starving. And the Ox who bears the People on his "
"back to their final rest. Many tales tell the story of the four parents.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The children said to Abba Arl, \"\"Tell us of the end first. Tell us of the "
"Ox who bears the People on his back to their final rest.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And this is the tale Abba Arl told.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Before the People settled in cities, they followed the herds of wild "
"beasts that roamed the wilderness and hunted them for food. One of these "
"hunters was named Colvy, and one day while he was hunting he happened upon a "
"calf. The calf was so young it could not yet walk, and its mother was dead "
"beside it.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The hunter Colvy took pity on the calf and brought it home to his hut. "
"He fed it the wild grains he had foraged from the fields, the berries that "
"grew in the shrubs, and the sweet leaves of trees.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"And the calf became like a son to Colvy, like one of his own family. And "
"even after the calf was grown, the hunter could not bear to kill and eat it, "
"so he kept it with him, by his side. And the calf, who was now a mighty ox, "
"loved the hunter as a father and a mother both. Nightly, the ox stood watch "
"by Colvy's hut and alerted him to danger. In return, the hunter protected "
"the ox against predators.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"And it came to pass that one day, when Colvy was hunting, he fell into a "
"nest of snakes and was badly bitten. And he said to the ox, 'I am bitten and "
"dying, you should leave me and join with the other wild herd beasts and run "
"across the fields.'\n"
"\n"
"\"\"But the ox replied, 'You are like a father and a mother to me. I will "
"not leave you.'\n"
"\n"
"\"\"So the ox waited by the hunter's side until late into the night when, "
"venom-sick and weary, the hunter finally died.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"And when the ox saw that the hunter, who had been like a father and a "
"mother, had died, the ox lowed with such force that the plains shook and the "
"herd beasts scattered in fear.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"And then the ox took Colvy on his back, went to the other hunters, and "
"said, 'This man found me as a calf. When my mother was dead, he fed me and "
"raised me into a mighty ox. He is like a father to me and also a mother, and "
"dearer to me than life itself. 'He fell into a nest of snakes, and the "
"serpents bit him and inserted their venom into his blood. And in the night, "
"he died.'\n"
"\n"
"\"\"On hearing the ox's speech, the other hunters replied, 'What do you "
"expect us to do? We are just hunters. We know nothing about anything. Our "
"own dead we leave in the fields, to be eaten by birds.'\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The ox replied, 'It is not right that the body of this noble hunter "
"should be left in the open, to be eaten by birds. Build a pyre and lay his "
"body on top of it. And when the hunter is burned, take me and kill me and "
"cook my flesh on the pyre. Eat this feast in memory of this noble hunter, "
"and I shall follow him into the next world and bear him to the afterlife, "
"just as he once bore me into his hut when I was only a calf and could not "
"yet walk.'\n"
"\n"
"The hunters saw wisdom in the ox's words, and they thought also of the great "
"feast that the mighty ox would provide, so they did as they were told.\n"
"\n"
"And seeing the loyalty of the ox to Colvy, the hunters followed his example "
"and began to herd the wild beasts, so that they would not need to follow "
"them all over the world, hunting them. And to this day, whenever a great "
"hunter dies, an ox is slaughtered and a feast is held. Then the bones of the "
"ox are laid upon the pyre to carry the dead into the afterlife.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"When Abba Arl had finished his tale, the children clapped their hands and "
"said, \"\"This is good. Thank you to the Ox, our fourth parent.\"\""

"Is it possible then that everything they taught us as children was wrong? "
"That buried beneath rock and sand, hidden from view by the monuments of "
"conquering Yokudans, is more than just the detritus of a barbaric and "
"underdeveloped people?\n"
"\n"
"This is the claim Sali'ma at-Muhay makes in his latest work of scholarship "
"on the Nedes and their presence in Hammerfell, and he presents some "
"compelling new evidence to support this claim. In studying the mage towers "
"in Elinhir closely, he has concluded that these towers are not of the right "
"age to be of Yokudan fabrication, nor do they use the same stone-crafting "
"techniques employed by the Ayleids. In some regards, they resemble Dwemer "
"handiwork, but only in a crude way. From this, at-Muhay concludes that these "
"towers were not a lost form of high Yokudan architecture transplanted from "
"the Yokudan homeland, but are in fact, the remnants of a Nedic civilization.\n"
"\n"
"If at-Muhay's conclusions are right, then the Nedes were much more organized "
"and advanced than historians have previously thought. Elinhir's towers could "
"only have been crafted by an advanced culture adept at stonework.\n"
"\n"
"These towers have been occupied since the Blackcaster mages established "
"their academy in Elinhir—so why is at-Muhay the first to propose this "
"startling theory?\n"
"\n"
"This author posits that historians are not without their blind spots, and "
"that the Nedes are certainly among the biggest. The reasons for this are "
"many:\n"
"\n"
"In the first, the Nedic people had a history of falling prey to conquering "
"armies. The Dwemer, the Ayleids, and the Yokudans all proclaimed themselves "
"masters of the Eastern Hammerfell Nedes at some point. It was in the "
"interests of these conquering peoples to justify their conquests by "
"proclaiming the Nedes a backward people worthy only of enslavement.\n"
"\n"
"In the second, the Nedes as a distinctive people disappear from the "
"historical record shortly after Ra Gada, and by then the records that exist "
"are few and scattered. By the time the first Yokudans set foot on the shores "
"of Hammerfell, the Nedic culture was already fading, and the people were "
"scattered and broken. Most of the Nedes had long since migrated and "
"intermingled with the other races of Tamriel, virtually fading from "
"existence.\n"
"\n"
"It's vital that we take this new theory about the Nedes seriously. I suspect "
"that the remote region of Craglorn will bear much fruit for future "
"researchers interested in exploring the extent of Nedic civilization, as it "
"has undergone the least change in the time since the last Nedes disappeared."

"\n"
"We come now to the \"\"Iron Orcs\"\" of Craglorn. I was shocked to find that "
"almost no scholarly work on the subject exists. It did not take me long to "
"find out why.\n"
"\n"
"Studying the Iron Orcs proved to be a difficult endeavor given that they are "
"uniformly hostile toward anyone perceived to be an outsider. \"\"Hostile\"\" "
"is an understatement in this case: during my time in Craglorn I routinely "
"found bodies hacked and cleaved, then pinned to trees with crude iron nails. "
"This was unsettling, but informative. What could drive such brutality, I "
"wondered. As with most things, the answer lay in the past.\n"
"\n"
"Study of ancient Orcish cave paintings and Nedic ruins revealed a surprising "
"number of stylistic similarities. These shared motifs clearly indicate a "
"rich cultural exchange between primitive Orcs and Nedes. Abandonment of this "
"shared symbology appears to have been gradual, indicating a prolonged period "
"of estrangement. Conflicts became more common and intense during periods of "
"rapid Nedic advancement in metal and stonecraft. Numerous Nedic frescos "
"depict armored warriors in conflict with unarmored Orcs. We can only assume "
"that these paintings depicted actual military victories against their less "
"developed neighbors. \n"
"\n"
"At some point in the late Merethic Era, a fundamental rearrangement of Iron "
"Orc civilization occurred.  What had been a largely peaceful, shamanistic "
"society rapidly transformed into a community of miners, smiths, and "
"warriors—much more in keeping with the conventional Orsimeric narrative. "
"There were some notable differences, however. The Iron Orcs adopted a "
"warfare methodology that was almost bestial in nature. My associates and I "
"discovered a series of mass graves filled with corpses in every state of "
"disrepair—broken spines, shattered skulls, cracked ribcages. Most of these "
"injuries were sustained after the killing blow, and many of the corpses bore "
"no weapons or armor of any kind.\n"
"\n"
"I believe the evidence we uncovered in Craglorn paints a compelling "
"narrative. The Iron Orcs (whose reverence for stone persists to this day) "
"were driven to mining and war by a desperate need to defend themselves and "
"the pristine stones they worshiped. In taking up the pick and spade, they "
"were committing a dreadful blasphemy. Anger eventually gave way to "
"hatred—specifically for the Nedes who drove them to this sacrilege. If this "
"interpretation is accurate, we can conclude that Iron Orc anger is anger of "
"the most dangerous kind: anger driven by self-loathing. In order to protect "
"their culture and the stone they worship, they had to twist both into "
"something dark and horrifying. I fear that it is an anger and quiet sadness "
"too dark and deep to ever truly recover from. We can only hope for a "
"cultural shift from within their own ranks. I suspect we will be waiting a "
"long time."

"Being an Account of the City of Mages\n"
"by Garold Farfly\n"
"\n"
"The one place in Craglorn where the light of civilization can be said to "
"shine is the gleaming city of Elinhir. \n"
"\n"
"Instantly recognizable by its ancient mage towers, monuments to a strange "
"and foreign age before Elf or Yokudan laid eyes on Craglorn, Elinhir stands "
"as a testament to the civilizing power of the scholar and the mage on an "
"otherwise wild population.\n"
"\n"
"Until the beginning of the Second Era, Elinhir was little more than a wild, "
"lawless backwater. Like most of Craglorn it was settled mainly by those "
"unfit for life inside the Empire. As such, it was a dangerous place, lacking "
"true leadership or even laws to govern it, and constant prey to the "
"predations of bandits and Iron Orc raiders from the mountains.\n"
"\n"
"Early in the Second Era, however, a group of mages led by the illuminated "
"Felix \"\"Blackcaster\"\" Augustus, left the comfort and confines of the "
"Mages Guild to practice their arts in Craglorn. \n"
"\n"
"Common myth suggests that Blackcaster and his mages were nothing more than "
"unruly, morally questionable, and undisciplined hedge mages, rebelling "
"against Mages Guild authority. This tale is perpetuated by the lawless "
"element that still lingers in Craglorn. They would have you believe that the "
"mages that first settled in Elinhir were no more a civilizing influence than "
"the bandits who regularly raided the city. \n"
"\n"
"This could not be farther from the truth! One need only comb the archives of "
"the Mages Guild in the Imperial City to learn that Felix Blackcaster was, in "
"fact, a guild member of high standing. His leaving the guild had nothing to "
"do with any disagreement in discipline or practice, but with the desire to "
"set out to new territories beyond the guild's reach. Correspondence shows "
"that Blackcaster remained in constant communication with his superiors in "
"the guild as late as ten years after the Apex Accord was signed by the "
"leaders of Elinhir.\n"
"\n"
"This correspondence sheds ample light on the situation Blackcaster and the "
"other mages found on their arrival in Elinhir and the lengths to which they "
"went to persuade the unruly populace to accept their leadership and "
"protection. I will not go into exhaustive detail, but I will summarize. "
"Blackcaster and his mages, intrigued by the sight of the then-empty Apex "
"Towers in the city, had previously pleaded with the town's mayor (he was "
"really more of a warlord) for access to the towers. Having been denied "
"multiple times, they were despondent and about to give up their quest. \n"
"\n"
"Their fortunes shifted, however, when Iron Orcs came down from the mountains "
"and laid siege to the city. Using their considerable power, Blackcaster and "
"his mages drove off the Orcs, quickly winning the love of the fickle people "
"of Elinhir. They acclaimed Blackcaster their new mayor and shortly after the "
"Apex Accord was struck—an agreement that stands to this day and states that "
"the mages of Elinhir's Apex Towers will provide protection for the city for "
"as long as the city supports them in the operation of their mages' academy.\n"
"\n"
"Some have argued that the appearance of the Iron Orcs is not all it seemed. "
"They have even gone so far as to declare that Blackcaster and his mages made "
"a deal with the Orcs in order to win over the people of Elinhir. I find this "
"suggestion both dubious and insulting. Such trickery would have been beneath "
"one of Felix Blackcaster's stature and reputation, not to mention the fact "
"that the Iron Orcs are notoriously intransigent in matters of cooperation "
"and negotiation.\n"
"\n"
"The truth is that from the time of the Apex Accord until now, Elinhir has "
"flourished under the guidance and protection of the Blackcaster mages, "
"becoming a prominent center of civilization in the wilderness of Craglorn."

"Being an account of the Dragonstar Caravan Company\n"
"by Garold Farfly\n"
"\n"
"It's well-known that the settlements of present-day Craglorn were founded by "
"a ragged and unsavory lot—criminals fleeing the close watch of the Imperials "
"in Cyrodiil, indigents from the cities of Shornhelm and Evermore, and "
"adventure-seekers looking to escape the comfort and confines of civilization."
"\n"
"\n"
"Nowhere is this black origin more plain than in the morals on display on the "
"streets of Belkarth. Little more than a hub of unscrupulous merchants, "
"thieves, and black market smugglers, the only government in Belkarth appears "
"to be the will of the scoundrels of the Dragonstar Caravan Company.\n"
"\n"
"In Belkarth, all manner of vices are tolerated and everything is for sale. "
"As an example of this depravity, I need only cite the now well-known tale of "
"Madriga. The daughter of a beloved and respected Crown, Madriga was seized "
"from her home in Evermore as payment for debts her father's steward had "
"incurred from agents of the Dragonstar Caravan Company. She was spirited off "
"to the treacherous reaches of Craglorn, where she resurfaced, ten years "
"later, as a barmaid in the Crossroads Tavern.\n"
"\n"
"Now the grown woman Madriga in no way resembled the demure and beautiful "
"child of her father's household. Indeed, she had grown into a haughty, "
"promiscuous woman, little better than the local strumpets with their brazen "
"demeanors. When guards from her father's household were sent to bring her "
"home so that she might be restored to her family and married into a noble "
"and honorable estate, it is said that she exclaimed, \"\"No, thank you. The "
"wages are better here.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I relate to you this tale so you will be warned if ever you have occasion to "
"deal with the Dragonstar Caravan Company. These so-called merchants have no "
"regard for the noble and established orders that have so long flourished in "
"civilized society. Their only master is gold, and they allow neither honor "
"nor decency to intervene in their service to their master."

"Today is the day I set off—fitting for a Scour Day, I suppose. New Life, new "
"roads, and all! I wonder if the Yokudans had an equivalent celebration, for "
"it is the Yokudans I pay a visit:\n"
"\n"
"I quest for the Hel Ra Citadel, a fabled fortress built by those vicious and "
"mysterious ancestors of the Redguard. As the Ayleid ruins serve to my people "
"as a window to my ancestors, so, too, do I expect the Citadel to teach me "
"about Redguard culture.\n"
"\n"
"They say no one has entered the Citadel in many lifetimes, though rumors of "
"the cultural treasures waiting inside have reached my ears. I flush to think "
"of them.\n"
"\n"
"Sun's Dawn 3rd,\n"
"\n"
"And so I arrive! The roads of Tamriel are as treacherous as ever—the "
"wildlife especially. The Welwas of Craglorn are akin to my Bosmer cousins: "
"fetid, petulant, and possessing of lethal denture. But at last I spy the "
"stone spires of Yokudan architecture. The Citadel must be just up ahead.\n"
"\n"
"Sun's Dawn 4th,\n"
"\n"
"I can barely keep the quill straight as I pen this, but, for the first time "
"in what must be a millennia, the antechamber that precedes the Citadel has "
"opened! I'll see to it that someone alerts the Mages Guild, the Merethic "
"Society, the Stargazers—all of Tamriel! Once I survey it, of course.\n"
"\n"
"One of the many legends that surround Hel Ra Citadel claims the Yokudans "
"used it as a training ground for their Ansei (literally \"\"sword "
"saints\"\")—blade masters capable of dazzling feats. In myth, the Ansei "
"required much meditation and training to form their Shehai, supernatural "
"blades constructed out of sheer force of will.\n"
"\n"
"I think the antechamber preceding the road to the Citadel gives credence to "
"the story, as do the ancient weapons left on the dais here (and not a single "
"one marred by rust—perhaps a magical property of the chamber?) According to "
"legend, Ansei wishing to earn the elite title of First Rank were required to "
"give up their most treasured weapons and war materiel before undertaking the "
"grueling initiation ritual. If they succeeded, they would no longer need "
"conventional weapons.\n"
"\n"
"My friends say I have spent too much time researching the Yokudans and that "
"I should find a husband. I think they are envious of my magnificent brain.\n"
"\n"
"Terms:\n"
"Yokeda- Leader? Lord of war?\n"
"Hel Shira- Blade Noble?\n"
"Yarban- A measurement of time? Unsure. Archaeologist, not a bean counter.\n"
"Anka-Ra- Former warrior? Old warrior?\n"
"Kotu- Weapon? Edge?\n"
"\n"
"Sun's Dawn 5th,\n"
"\n"
"Fascinating as the antechamber has proven to be, it's time I gleaned the "
"Citadel itself. What could await me there? Mirimdin's Ninth Blade? The "
"Shehai of a First-Rank Ansei? I carry no sword, but I shall leave my journal "
"here, as the Ansei left their swords. Perhaps, like them, I'll find the "
"means to form my own Shehai."

"(compiled from the notes of Muhay at-Turna by his disciple)\n"
"\n"
"It is a source of no small irony to me that the discovery for which I am "
"most likely to be remembered is the so-called Ruins of Kardala, which I "
"found purely by accident when I was still an apprentice.\n"
"\n"
"I spent that year (the hundred and first of the Second Era) in the company "
"of a small guild sequestered in the foothills of the Dragontail Mountains. I "
"call the group a guild for lack of a better term. They lived much like "
"priests in a religious order, sharing everything and spending many hours of "
"each day buried in books. \n"
"\n"
"But to call them priests would seem to suggest that they were in some way "
"reverent, which they were not. Late into most nights, we stayed awake "
"drinking and telling bawdy tales—even the oldest members of the order joined "
"in. \n"
"\n"
"Yet guild is not quite an accurate term, either. It suggests uniformity, and "
"these men and women from across Tamriel were a motley bunch, a patchwork of "
"young and old, educated and dullards. They argued constantly, in the most "
"friendly fashion, calling each other names one moment and then laughing the "
"next. They could not even agree on what the order was called. The older "
"members insisted on the elaborate and archaic \"\"Esteemed Order of the "
"Observers of the Celestial Motions and Portents,\"\" while younger members "
"preferred the simple and evocative name \"\"Star-Gazers.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"A singular concern united the group. They shared a complete devotion to the "
"study of the stars and the meaning of their motions, and that was the reason "
"I had come among their number in that year of my apprenticeship. I, too, had "
"a fascination with the heavens, and I hoped to benefit as much as I could "
"from the breadth of their knowledge in order to further my own inquiries "
"into the relationship of the stars to the properties of magic.\n"
"\n"
"Here, I must confess, that my time spent with the Star-Gazers did much to "
"open my young eyes. After the first few months I sank into a deep "
"depression, realizing that my interest in the relationship of the "
"constellations to magic had already been thoroughly explored in a manner "
"that seemed to be utterly complete. An apprentice such as myself could spend "
"a lifetime reading what had already been written and in the end have not a "
"single word of my own to contribute.\n"
"\n"
"However, as I spent more time in my study and among the Star-Gazers, I "
"learned that there were many questions yet to be answered about the stars "
"themselves. For all we understand about the workings of magic, we know very "
"little about the workings of the heavens themselves. In fact, the more "
"prosaic the question appears at first glance, the more likely it is that the "
"answer yet eludes us. \n"
"\n"
"Just as I thought that all questions had been answered and there was no "
"hope, I became energized once more by a flood of questions, each more "
"startling than the last. Indeed, for all the knowledge that the great "
"scholars had brought to their theories of magic, they could not answer how "
"it is that the Mundus Stones came to be, or by what trickery the Serpent "
"slips across the sky, knowing no season.\n"
"\n"
"In fact, I soon realized that not one of the three great scholars of magic "
"had ever set foot in Craglorn. How they could ignore the place where the "
"Nedes once worshiped the stars and set the Mundus Stones in their "
"foundations, I would never understand. \n"
"\n"
"It was through this realization that Kardala was discovered. Energized by "
"the thought of reaching new conclusions through first-hand observation, I "
"entreated my very willing hosts to guide me into the desert. I hoped to "
"study the Mundus Stones of the Lord, the Lady, and the Steed and find "
"something new.\n"
"\n"
"Several books on the subject of Kardala have flattered me by embellishing "
"history. They claim that by examining these Mundus Stones of the Warrior's "
"charges, I surmised from their configuration that there must be another "
"Mundus Stone connected to the Warrior within sight of the three stones.\n"
"\n"
"This could not be further from the truth. While we were on our journey "
"through the desert, I had consumed a great deal of water to fortify my "
"health. As is known to happen, that water had to go somewhere. I excused "
"myself, stepping just a little off the road, and let nature run its course. "
"On my way back to my colleagues I became disoriented, and as I struggled to "
"find the road a loose stone slipped beneath my foot. I fell back and avoided "
"falling into the crack that broke open beneath me, revealing the entrance to "
"Kardala.\n"
"\n"
"Naturally, my companions were excited beyond words. I credit them with some "
"of the misinformation that has spread about Kardala's discovery. In fact, I "
"never would have made the discovery without their willingness to guide me "
"into the desert that day."

"We know that the Dwarves had an advanced understanding of astronomy. To this "

"\n"
"But Ibrula has always been unusual—lately more so. Some of the others heard "
"her muttering something under her breath. Her latest delusion seems to be "
"that the world is about to be attacked by some hitherto unknown force.\n"
"\n"
"We told her that the atronachs summoned by the mages of Elinhir have the "
"worm cult well in hand and the Prince of Schemes has no hold in Craglorn, "
"but she was not consoled by this.\n"
"\n"
"In spite of her eccentricities, or perhaps because of them, we are all very "
"worried about Ibrula. We have decided to wait until morning and then send a "
"party to try to find her.\n"
"\n"
"—\n"
"\n"
"We have come across a small house, surrounded by all manner of magical wards."
" Torn pieces of a book indicate that Ibrula was here at some point, and her "
"scrawl marks a sign at the entrance to the place, warning us away. Did she "
"fall victim to these traps? Or did she create them? And if so, to what end? "
"To keep us out? Or to keep something else in?\n"
"\n"
"Either way, it's apparent that Ibrula's delusion has grown worse than we'd "
"imagined.\n"
"\n"
"—\n"
"\n"
"After a few days (I've lost count, and it grows harder to concentrate the "
"longer we're here) of trying to pass through the traps, discord has seized "
"our search party. We are besieged by nightmares in the dark, and an "
"incessant whispering by day. \n"
"\n"
"A voice in my head torments me with the promise of knowledge immeasurable. I "
"suspect a Daedric presence in this place.\n"
"\n"
"—\n"
"\n"
"My worst suspicions are now confirmed. Daedra have appeared, called to this "
"place by an unknown voice, and cutting off our retreat. The twins Maelon and "
"Melancthon are now dead, tricked into murdering each other by whatever "
"madness rules this place.\n"
"\n"
"As for me, I am hopelessly lost. I believe I will die before I find Ibrula "
"or escape this place.\n"
"Would that we had heeded Ibrula's warning and stayed far away."
