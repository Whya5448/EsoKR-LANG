"Observations by Raynard, Academic of Mournhold\n"
"\n"
"They call them Dreamwalkers. Beings that can, with a simple spell, step into "
"the dreams of another. Your darkest desires, your most bizarre fantasies, "
"your true self, all revealed to these Dreamwalkers like an open book. Your "
"most prized memories ransacked and picked through like the leavings of last "
"night's feast.\n"
"\n"
"Those who Dreamwalk are said to have sworn themselves to the Daedric Prince "
"Vaermina. To have sold their souls for the ability to enter her plane, the "
"Dreamstride. The veracity of this claim, I cannot say, but the similarities "
"between what Dreamwalkers do and what the Priests of Vaermina accomplish is "
"quite uncanny.\n"
"\n"
"The only difference I could ascertain was how each entered the dream state. "
"Vaermina's priests require nothing more than the drop of an alchemical "
"concoction, a draft prepared by the most brilliant alchemists. The "
"Dreamwalkers, however, require no such potion. They conjure a magic that "
"appears to be innate, not taught or passed down by some hereditary process. "
"Were they blessed by the Daedric Prince? Did their parents perform some "
"sacred ritual to acquire this power upon birth? None I have spoken to truly "
"know. Or will say, one way or another.\n"
"\n"
"But what of the Dreamwalkers themselves? What do they use this power to "
"achieve? Think of the havoc one could cause by entering the dreams of "
"another. That's a frightening thought, indeed.\n"
"\n"
"Yet, the Dreamwalkers I met were kind and gentle. They use their powers to "
"help others. They eliminate painful memories. Cure mental illnesses that not "
"even the best healers can mend. They accomplish incredible things by simply "
"touching a person's dreams. I know, for I saw a Dreamwalker in action.\n"
"\n"
"My wife and children contracted the Knahaten Flu. It was a terrible way to "
"die, slow and painful. When they died, my reason to live died with them. But "
"the Dreamwalker I met, he took pity on me. He gave me an opportunity to "
"remember my family while forgetting the pain of losing them. To become numb "
"to the loss and remember them as they were before the illness. To remember "
"the happiness and the love.\n"
"\n"
"The Dreamwalker entered my dreams. When I woke, a calmness had filled me. "
"Everything was all right. I could go on with my life. I wanted to thank him, "
"but he was gone. I never saw him again.\n"
"\n"
"Whoever the Dreamwalkers are, whatever master they ultimately serve, I will "
"forever be in their debt. But this fact doesn't eliminate the fear that "
"lingers at the back of my mind. Was it right to take away the pain?  Aren't "
"memories the thing that makes us unique? Have I become someone else because "
"my memories have been changed? It seems I have replaced pain with fear, and "
"I'm not sure which I prefer."

"By Narsis Dren, Treasure Hunter\n"
"\n"
"Dotting the landscape of Skyrim, the ancient Nord ruins are a testament to "
"the ingenuity of the Nord people of the past. When constructing the final "
"resting places for the noble class, our ancestors proved to be quite crafty, "
"developing some of the most sophisticated and clever defenses I have ever "
"encountered. Coupled with the presence of the fearsome draugr, these tombs "
"have become quite a challenge for me.\n"
"\n"
"The most often-overlooked obstacles are the abundance of traps spread "
"throughout the tombs. Ranging from simple tripwire-activated rock falls to "
"complex pressure plate-triggered dart traps, the ancient Nords utilized "
"these devices abundantly. Most of the traps can be bypassed by simply "
"looking for the trigger mechanism and avoiding them. Since they are most "
"often placed in areas where distractions abound, remember to keep your eyes "
"to the floor.\n"
"\n"
"One of the keys to surviving in a Nord ruin is to use these traps to gain an "
"upper hand against any denizens occupying the ruin. In many cases, it's "
"trivial to lure them across the triggering mechanism. Try this when you find "
"an oil trap. Using a bow, lure your victim onto the oil and then loose an "
"arrow at the fire pot hanging above. The moment the fire pot shatters, the "
"entire pool of oil ignites and engulfs the enemy in hot death. Just be "
"certain that you're standing clear of the oil, or else this trick could end "
"your expedition earlier than you planned.\n"
"\n"
"Perhaps one of the most amazing engineering marvels of all has little to do "
"with the traps designed to kill. Utilizing all manner of pull chains, "
"levers, switches, and pressure plates, some of the most frustrating "
"obstacles can occur in the form of puzzles that threaten to block your "
"progress. Watch for the telltale signs of these barriers: groups of levers "
"in a single place, rotating pillars with carvings on all faces, and even "
"large arrays of pressure plates covering the floor of a room. In most cases, "
"the puzzle requires experimentation to solve. In others, the solution might "
"actually be found elsewhere in the complex. It's recommended to keep a "
"writing implement and a journal handy so that you can always take notes "
"about whatever you find. You never know when you might need to refer to "
"something from elsewhere in the complex.\n"
"\n"
"Although Nord ruins are commonly infested with vermin, including skeevers "
"and spiders, these creatures pale in comparison to the mighty draugr. These "
"horrific, animated dead are commonly found as guardians in most of the "
"tombs, and they defend them mercilessly. Since the draugr tend to lay "
"dormant until someone happens upon their resting place, it's advisable to "
"keep an eye out for niches and sarcophagi. These undead animate rapidly and "
"silently, so always watch your back. Any remains you pass could suddenly "
"animate and set upon you without warning.\n"
"\n"
"The perils of a Nord ruin are not without reward. The burial chambers in "
"some of the larger complexes contain all manners of riches, from gold to the "
"occasional enchanted weapon or armor. Never ignore the ceremonial urns that "
"dot the ruins, as they are often filled with ancient offerings of great "
"value.\n"
"\n"
"I've tried to be comprehensive with what I know of Nord ruins, but I'm sure "
"there are dangers lurking within that will prove to be unique and never "
"before seen. Just be sure to always enter these tombs with plenty of "
"equipment and a good, solid weapon by your side. With a bit of patience, a "
"keen eye, and a light step, a Nord ruin can bring you great wealth. If you "
"follow my advice. Otherwise, you risk becoming a permanent resident, like "
"many of those who tried to loot the place before you."

"노드인은 이러한 장치를 폭넓게 사용한다. 대부분의 경우에는, 작동장치를 미리 발견하여 해당 장치를 건드리지 않으면 된다. 함정주변에 "
"작동장치가 있는 경우가 대다수이기 때문에 주로 바닥쪽을 주의하는 것이 좋은 방법이다.\n"
"\n"
"노드의 유적에서 살아 남는 방법 중 하나가, 함정을 능숙하게 이용하여, 무덤을 지키는 존재들보다 전략적으로 우위에 서는 것이다.  "
"대다수의 경우, 작동장치쪽으로 적들을 유인하는 방법을 쓴다. 이 방법은 기름함정에서도 사용할 수 있다. 원거리 공격을 사용해 공격목표를 "

"조작하여 실험해볼 수 있으며, 유적 어딘가에서 힌트나 답을 찾을 수 있다. 나중을 위해서 필기용구와 일지를 준비해 두는 것을 권장한다.\n"
"\n"
"노드의 유적에는 보통 스키버나 거미등의 해충이 출몰하지만, 드로거과 비교하면 사소한 재난에 불과하다. 이 움직이는 무서운 시체는 대부분 "
"무덤에서 경비병으로서 출몰하며, 무덤을 지킴에 있어서 그 무자비함을 보여준다. 드로거는 누군가가 우연히 만나지 않는 이상 휴면하는 경향이 "
"있어서, 들어갈때 좁은 틈새나 석관을 주의하는 편이 좋다. 이 언데드는 재빠르고 조용히 움직이기 때문에, 항상 뒤를 조심해야 한다. "
"지나간 길 뒤쪽에서 시체가 갑자기 움직이기 시작하여 경고없이 당신을 덮칠지도 모른다.\n"

"노드유적을 탐험하는 것으로 얻는 것도 있다. 큰 건조물의 매장실에는 어떤 종류의 보물이 들어있으며, 금화가 있거나, 마법이 걸린 무기나 "
"방어구가 있는 경우도 있다. 유적안에 존재하는 의식용의 뼈단지는 결코 무시해서는 안 된다. 대부분의 경우 매우 가치가 있는 고대의 "

"이 문서가 유적에 대한 종합적인 안내서라고 생각될지도 모르겠지만, 아직 발견되지 않은 것들 중에서도 틀림없이 위험이 잠복하고 있다. "
"무덤에 들어갈 때엔 항상 많은 장비와 도구, 그리고 튼튼한 무기를 준비해두지 않으면 안된다. 약간의 인내와 예리한 눈으로 주의하면서 "
"슬그머니 걷다보면, 노드의 유적은 커다란 부를 가져다준다. 반면에 단순한 안전 대책을 게을리하면, 수많은 그 분야의 선구자들과 같이 "

"\n"
"The clans of the Nords spread across Skyrim like herds of mammoths, though "
"their numbers and influence upon the land are far greater. Each clan, "
"however, makes its mark in a different way. Some clans are known for their "
"hunting skills, or their forestry, or their crafting. Some clans are large, "
"others small. Some take a prominent role in government and community. And "
"then there are the dark clans. The clans no one deals with or even speaks of."
" One such clan is the infamous Stormfists of Whiterun Tundra.\n"
"\n"
"The clan traces its lineage to Ogra Stormfist, the powerful matriarch who "
"founded the clan and ruled over it for almost fifty years. Highly regarded "
"for their combat skills and armor crafting, the Stormfist clan played "
"pivotal roles in numerous conflicts over the centuries, including the Battle "
"of Whiterun Hold, the Massacre at Dialmarch, and the Siege of Windhelm. It "
"was the last engagement, however, that led to the clan's fall from favor and "
"marked it as anathema.\n"
"\n"
"Prior to the Second Akaviri Invasion, Fildgor Strong-Prince, son of Queen "
"Mabjaarn of Eastern Skyrim, went on a pilgrimage to the west to see the land "
"and meet the people. He fell in with young men and women from the Stormfist "
"clan and forged friendships and bonds that would serve him well in the "
"coming years. When Fildgor was ready to move on and perform his coming-of-"
"age trials, an entourage of Stormfist clan members decided to go with him. "
"They became known as the Stormfist Brigade, and even though he wasn't a "
"member of the clan by birth, Fildgor became their de facto leader.\n"
"\n"
"If the Stormfist clan had a reputation prior to this, it paled in comparison "
"to the legend that grew around the Stormfist Brigade. They were ferocious "
"warriors, setting off for adventure in the most hostile and isolated areas "
"of the kingdom. With Fildgor leading the way, they routed bandits, uncovered "
"treasure, and slew monsters. When the Akaviri invaders arrived in force, "
"Fildgor led the Brigade into the thick of battle. They eventually fought "
"their way to Windhelm to join forces with Queen Mabjaarn and the main army. \n"
"\n"
"Although they weren't able to stop the fall of Windhelm or save the queen, "
"the Stormfist Brigade was nonetheless instrumental in helping to route the "
"invading army. They marched as part of the combined Nord forces that "
"eventually joined with the Dark Elves and Argonians to defeat the Akaviri. "
"But then the fateful decision was made. When Fildgor declared his intention "
"to ascend the throne left empty by his sister Nurnhilde's death, the "
"Stormfist clan was among his most vocal backers. You know how that story "
"ends. Jorunn and Fildgor met in single combat, and Jorunn won the throne. "
"Fildgor was exiled, and he departed Skyrim with a promise to one day return.\n"
"\n"
"The Stormfist clan, loyal to Fildgor to the end, refused to bow before "
"Jorunn or acknowledge his authority over them. They returned to their "
"holdings to the west, and King Jorunn, tired of all the fighting, let them "
"go. To this day, the Stormfist clan remains isolated, rarely venturing out "
"of its domain or taking part in the larger Nord community. What will happen "
"if the clan ever decides to to leave its tundra-lands and reassert its place "
"among the other clans is anyone's guess. Especially if Fildgor ever makes "
"good on his promise."

"Observations on the Giantish Peoples of Skyrim from the journals of Bonorion "
"the Wanderer, 2E 569\n"
"\n"
"Having explored the snowy reaches of Eastmarch and the Rift, I have had "
"opportunities to observe the strange and rather large people the Skyrim "
"natives call \"\"giants.\"\" The natives of Skyrim are rather large "
"themselves, but the giants that roam the wilderness are twice the size (or "
"more!) of your average thick-necked, broad-shouldered Nord. Here are some "
"observations, recorded for future travelers to this chilly clime:\n"
"\n"
"Giants are tall.\n"
"\n"
"Giants seem peaceful enough. Until you threaten them. Then they swing huge "
"clubs and launch even a burly Nord over field and stream. The trip probably "
"kills the Nord. That would be my guess, as I've never been able to interview "
"a survivor of a giant's swing. \n"
"\n"
"Things that seem to threaten giants include, but are not limited to:  \n"
"      Going near them. \n"
"      Threatening their mammoths.\n"
"      Shooting arrows at them.\n"
"\n"
"No one that I have spoken to has ever seen a female giant or a young giant. "
"Are giant children taller than Bosmer? Are female giants painfully shy? This "
"calls for additional observation. \n"
"\n"
"Giants paint rocks and trees near their encampments. This primitive art "
"probably entices the rare female giantess who might wander by. Or the "
"decorations mark territory. Or the giants simply like to paint. This calls "
"for further study.\n"
"\n"
"How does a giant milk a mammoth? VERY carefully. (Note: Nords found this "
"joke to be very amusing. Especially after several mugs of mead.) \n"
"\n"
"No Nord I spoke to has ever tasted mammoth cheese. They seem to have no "
"interest in doing so. \n"
"\n"
"I shall have to find a way to befriend one of these large creatures. That's "
"the only way I can think of to get a sample of that wonderful smelling "
"cheese.\n"
"\n"
"Note from Jeggord the Learned, 2E 571\n"
"\n"
"The Wood Elf Bonorion was found at the base of large hill near the area "
"known as Cradlecrush. Given the condition of his body, that is, every bone "
"broken, it appears that he ignored his own advice. Even the dimmest Nord "
"children know better than to approach a giant. As the nearest giant camp was "
"nearly a league from where his body was found, I would say that Wood Elves "
"can travel great distances when launched by a giant's club. \n"
"\n"
"I have preserved his journal as a cautionary tale for future explorers of "
"Eastmarch, the Rift, and other regions where giants make their homes. Heed "
"its advice, even if its author did not: don't try to befriend a giant."

"\n"
"A wide variety of spirits roam the lonely paths of Skyrim. Some are fierce "
"and terrible, hateful and jealous of mortal creatures. Others are simply "
"mischievous, full of playful wickedness that can turn dangerous if the "
"target isn't completely aware of what's happening. A few can be benevolent, "
"but even these can turn hostile if the proper decorum and respect aren't "
"adhered to. These spirits range from free-roaming Daedra to the mortal dead "
"to nature personified, though such distinctions may not matter much if you "
"become embroiled in a haunted encounter. What do you care if the spirit "
"harassing you is a marauding Daedra or the lingering shade of a village "
"peasant? It's still just as insubstantial. It's still just as dangerous.\n"
"\n"
"The Haunted Wood, far to the south of Windhelm, has long been a place of "
"mystery and danger. A multitude of stories describe how sparkling lights or "
"compelling whispers lure travelers deep into the forest. Of even local "
"farmers and loggers who should know better falling victim to strange sounds "
"and even stranger sights that can occur when the sun rides high in the sky "
"or when darkness covers the land.\n"
"\n"
"One such spirit is a guardian spirit tied to a specific natural landmark, "
"such as a lake, a hill, or a copse of woods. The guardian spirit haunts the "
"area it is connected to, and cannot abandon or wander far from the location. "
"A guardian spirit might take on a mortal shape when appearing before mortal "
"creatures, but make no mistake: these spirits were never mortal and are as "
"different from the mortal world as the residents of Oblivion. They might "
"imitate mortal behavior, but they neither understand it nor have any but the "
"most tenuous connection to it.\n"
"\n"
"A guardian spirit might get bored with its routine. It might become curious "
"about new creatures wandering into its environment. It might even become "
"angry at a presumed slight by a mortal visiting its realm. Any or all of "
"these situations might draw the attention of a guardian spirit upon you. Or "
"it might be something else entirely that draws them to you. Who can tell "
"what motivates these strange entities?\n"
"\n"
"The guardian spirit associated with the Haunted Wood tends to be curious and "
"mischievous, but has rarely shown outright hostility to mortal visitors. "
"Stories abound of missing objects, strange appearances, and playful teasing, "
"but there are few accounts of the forest turning against mortal visitors. It "
"seems that, for this spirit at least, some kind of connection is trying to "
"be made. Or, perhaps, this too is a misinterpretation of intent. Perhaps "
"this guardian spirit is simply attempting to lull visitors into letting "
"their guard down. And then the spirit will pounce."

"\n"
"The Crown of Freydis, worn by our beloved Queen Mabjaarn, has a long history."
" Many know of the crown's famed beauty, but few know the true intent of the "
"crown and why it was created—and that it was even worn by other monarchs "
"before Queen Freydis. \n"
"\n"
"The Crown of Freydis is actually the second royal crown of Skyrim. The "
"fabled Jagged Crown holds the distinction of being the first. The Jagged "
"Crown was forged by Harald, first king of the Nords, from the bones of "
"dragons. Legend has it that the Jagged Crown disappeared with the death of "
"Harald's final descendant King Borgas in The Wild Hunt of 1E 369. The death "
"of childless King Borgas, last of the line of Ysgramor, triggered an "
"internecine conflict known as the War of Succession.\n"
"\n"
"The War of Succession raged for more than fifty years before Olaf One-Eye "
"became the new High King of Skyrim. Olaf was elected to the position "
"primarily due to the renown he garnered subduing the dragon Numinex, and not "
"for any benevolence or statesmanship on his part. The rule of Olaf One-Eye "
"was a time marked by great strife and division among the Nords. When he also "
"died without a clear heir, it was decided that a new manner be employed for "
"choosing a new High King. \n"
"\n"
"Each of Skyrim's holds sent a mage to a convocation called specifically to "
"craft a magical artifact that would test the worth of potential candidates "
"for High King. To this end, they created the Crown of Verity. Crafting the "
"artifact in the shape of a crown was a brilliant innovation. With the loss "
"of the Jagged Crown, Olaf had worn no mark of recognizable rulership. They "
"felt that a new crown would help unify the realm behind a new king after the "
"relative instability of Olaf's rule. The timing of the crown's creation "
"proved to be auspicious.\n"
"\n"
"The Moot selected a tribal chieftain named Asurn Ice-Breaker to be the next "
"High King of Skyrim. Asurn was a mighty warrior of unmatched skill in the "
"vein of Olaf One-Eye, though he never defeated a dragon. Before he assumed "
"the role, however, he had to don the newly-forged Crown of Verity. That's "
"when the true power of the artifact became apparent.\n"
"\n"
"The crown rejected Asurn. It literally refused to be placed upon his head. "
"In a rage, Asurn summoned his loyal followers and threatened to kill every "
"member of the Moot if they didn't name him as the rightful king. He refused "
"to be rejected by a crown. A soft-spoken member of the council rose from his "
"chair. He challenged Asurn to combat, according to the law. The battle was "
"short and to the point: Asurn was struck down. When the soft-spoken man took "
"the crown and placed it easily upon his own head, a new High King of Skyrim "
"was born. That was how Kjoric the White rose to power.\n"
"\n"
"To this day, the Crown of Freydis has been passed down from High King to "
"High King. It is used as a tool by the Moot to ascertain the worthiness of "
"any candidate for the throne. Since the day Asurn was struck down, no one "
"has challenged the validity of the Crown or its powers—until 2E 431, when "
"the Reman Empire fell asunder, and King Logrolf was assassinated. \n"
"\n"
"Jarl Svartr of Solitude claimed that Logrolf's daughter, Freydis, was "
"illegitimate, and therefore a Moot was required to choose a successor. "
"Though Freydis, wearing the Crown of Verity, was named High Queen in "
"Windhelm, a partial Moot in Solitude chose Svartr as High King. Thereafter "
"the West Kingdom was ruled by Svartr and his successors, while the East "
"Kingdom was ruled by the heirs to Freydis, who renamed the Crown of Verity "
"in her honor."

"No pest has proven more resilient to the Nords of Skyrim than the common Orc."
" The tusked people claim occupancy of our fair realm, stretching back before "
"the time Ysgramor crossed the Sea of Ghosts. Though few written accounts "
"still exist of that time, there is mention in the histories of the "
"Companions uprooting Orc strongholds even as they burned the Snow Elves from "
"the land.\n"
"\n"
"Orc strongholds are well defended outposts often situated around deposits of "
"mineral wealth. Each contains the infrastructure to support a dozen or more "
"families, surrounded by walls designed to repel anything but the strongest "
"martial force. Many jarls are remembered in song for dying vainly while "
"attempting to root a stronghold from their lands. Worse, destroyed "
"strongholds often return within a generation of their destruction if not "
"countered by a Nord fort that needs a constant supply of troops and "
"provisions. \n"
"\n"
"Few jarls can afford to defend piles of rock for more than a few years, and "
"thus the Orc strongholds remain a pox upon our land. Some strongholds have "
"persisted in this way for hundreds, if not thousands, of years. It's said "
"that the ancient Orc stronghold of Cradlecrush in Eastmarch has never been "
"taken by force or abandoned, despite the complete exhaustion of the mineral "
"vein it sits upon.\n"
"\n"
"The height of Orcish power in Skyrim came with the establishment of "
"Yashnag's Chiefdom in the early Second Era. With the destruction of Orsinium "
"by the combined Breton and Redguard forces, the Orcs were scattered across "
"the North in a great exodus. Yashnag and his people, exiled from High Rock, "
"fled east to reclaim lands in Skyrim they felt were theirs by ancient right. "
"The King of West Skyrim, Svartr, was ineffective in holding back the Orcs "
"and the Reachmen that plagued the West Kingdom during his rule. The chiefdom "
"was a bane upon Western Falkreath for more than thirty years, until it was "

"field of battle. The young jarl inherited little more than a crumbling hold "
"largely occupied by Orcish invaders from the west. It is said that Hakkvild "
"challenged Yashnag and a host of Yashnag's Orc champions to a ritual trial "
"by combat. He defeated each in turn. How Hakkvild learned of this obscure "
"Orcish ritual is not known, but with their leader's defeat, Yashnag's "
"followers abandoned the chiefdom.\n"
"\n"
"With the destruction of the chiefdom, the Orcs scattered further into Skyrim "
"or back into the mountains of Wrothgar. Orc clans descended from Yashnag's "
"people have an intense hatred of the Kings of Skyrim. It's ironic that this "
"enmity for the Nords has grown, even as the Orcs themselves have re-"
"established ties with the peoples of western Tamriel that burned their first "
"home hundreds of years ago."

"By Elgad the Scribe\n"
"\n"
"Some call them a cult. Others say worse things. But the Ternion Monks carry "
"on a tradition that honors the Three Old Gods and the totems associated with "
"them. While the religion is ancient, its followers are few. In many "
"respects, the Ternion movement is slowly dying, as very little proselytizing "
"takes place by the current contingent of monks. Fewer and fewer converts "
"take up the worship of the Three Old Gods, and soon the religion may become "
"nothing but a vague memory.\n"
"\n"
"Known for their healing magic, the Ternion Monks can call forth aspects of "
"the Three Old Gods. With the help of these aspects, the monks can perform "
"tasks beyond the scope of mere mortal limitations. The aspects take the "
"forms of the Three Old Gods: the Fox, the Bear, and the Wolf.\n"
"\n"
"The Fox is crafty and quick, and its aspect enhances the speed and agility "
"of the monks who call upon him.\n"
"\n"
"The Bear is strong, mighty. A protector. The aspect of the Bear enhances "
"strength and shields those who call upon him from harm.\n"
"\n"
"The Wolf is sly and observant, ferocious and deadly. She watches and waits, "
"looking for the best opportunity to make her move. The aspect of the Wolf "
"enhances vision and perception, allowing those who call upon her to see more "
"clearly, to notice the hidden and the obscure.\n"
"\n"
"The Ternion Monks prefer nigh-inaccessible spots as places to meditate and "
"worship. Often, the only way to get to these holy retreats is to use the "
"magic of the monks. A guardian is always appointed to open the way to the "
"retreat, but will only do so for other monks or if the need is great and the "
"requester is worthy.\n"
"\n"
"I have spent time with the monks, learned something of their ways and seen "
"their healing magic in action. I believe that they are good people, "
"following a worthy tradition. But I fear that when this generation comes to "
"an end, the Ternion Monks and the Three Old Gods they worship will fade away."
"\n"
"\n"
"And that will be a sad day, indeed."

"The Akaviri land their ships in force. Several have been turned away or "

"\n"
"The Akaviri ships have dropped anchor back from the beach. Perhaps they fear "
"our blades. I say let them starve themselves in their ships, but Princess "
"Nurnhilde believes they plot, rather than cower. She is wiser than I, so I "
"have sent scouts to find and foil any cowardly, underhanded tactics they "
"might be ready to deploy.\n"
"\n"
"19 Sun's Height\n"
"\n"
"More than a week, and still the Akaviri do not attack. The soldiers grow "
"restless, and Princess Nurnhilde broods. Scouts have returned without any "
"information. Still, I continue to send them out day after day. None have "
"spoken against me, but I see their looks as I order yet another patrol along "
"the beaches.\n"
"\n"
"The Blood Claws were made for slaughter, not waiting.\n"
"\n"
"22 Sun's Height\n"
"\n"
"Arguments and fighting in the camp, and the Akaviri still wait with their "
"fleet, just beyond of our grasp. We've heard reports of attacks north and "
"south of us, along the coast, even as far south as the Dark Elf lands. The "
"troops wonder why we wait when fighting takes place elsewhere. And wonder "
"begins to turn to anger.\n"
"\n"
"Princess Nurnhilde insists that this is their main fleet, and that they are "
"trying to lure us away from our position. When she speaks, the soldiers "
"become calm and thoughtful. She cuts right through their anger and "
"bitterness. I wish she would address them more often.\n"

"An Akaviri ship landed today. It hit the beach in the darkness just before "
"morning. Our soldiers surrounded it, expecting a hail of arrows from within, "
"but none came. It was odd that such a large ship beached itself, but the "
"troops were bored and hungry for blood. The magical traps on the ship "
"claimed the lives of seven warriors.\n"
"\n"
"I have never seen the troops so angry. Even the Princess had trouble calming "
"them. When the Akaviri land, they will be torn to shreds. If we don't tear "

"Reports of the Dark Elf lands being overrun. There is little love lost "
"between Nords and Dark Elves, but at this moment we share the frustration "

"warriors hunger for combat.\n"
"\n"
"I spoke with the Princess. I told her this news may have pushed the Blood "
"Claws to a new level of rage. She said nothing, only pressed her lips "
"together. She's always several steps ahead of the rest of us, and I fear she "
"has seen something I have yet to notice.\n"

"The Akaviri landed this morning, a massive wave of destruction crashing upon "
"the beach. Our soldiers were whipped into a frenzy as the call to arms rang "
"out. They were reckless, and the first rush was cut down by archers before a "
"proper line could be formed. Our recklessness cost us the beach, and the "
"invaders now have a foothold in our land.\n"
"\n"
"3 Last Seed\n"
"\n"
"We had to fall back. Fighting was too intense and Princess Nurnhilde ordered "
"the troops back to Windhelm. We'll fight from the walls and use the strength "
"of the city to crush the invaders once and for all!\n"
"\n"
"4 Last Seed\n"
"\n"
"Tension runs high tonight, as we wait for the Akaviri to press forward. I "
"saw Nurnhilde donning armor. The Blood Claws will follow her, listen to her "

"Queen Mabjaarn and Princess Nurnhilde are dead. Nurnhilde led the Blood "
"Claws into combat when the gates of Windhelm fell. They fought like I have "
"never seen anyone fight before, raging in perfect coordination. When the "
"queen went down, the rage took over, though Nurnhilde donned the crown and "
"try to restore order to our lines. The Akaviri were driven from the city. "
"They thought to goad us, and they did, but the beast they awoke was more "
"than they could handle.\n"
"\n"
"But then they came back. Now Queen Nurnhilde is dead. I should have been "
"able to command my warriors, control them. It should have been me, not her. "
"The responsibility for their deaths is mine, and I will explain that to the "
"princes personally."

"At the height of the Akaviri Invasion, in 2E 572, the twin brothers of "
"Princess Nurnhilde, Jorunn the Skald Prince and Fildgor Strong Prince (also "
"called Fildgor Angry Prince, but never to his face), were in two very "
"different locations. Jorunn was in Riften with his closest companions, the "
"Pack of Bards. Fildgor, meanwhile, was on the northeast coast of Skyrim, "
"fighting alongside his sister when the Akaviri of Dir-Kamal launched their "
"assault. As the Akaviri made their way toward Windhelm, Jorunn and his "
"companions forged their own path toward the fabled Nord city.\n"
"\n"
"Fildgor, meanwhile, demonstrated his fighting prowess, as well as his "
"exalted anger, over and over again as the battle for the coast raged on. He "
"often led his own team of companions, the Stormfist Brigade, which consisted "
"of members of the Stormfist clan. They had fought beside Fildgor during his "
"pilgrimage and coming-of-age trials, and were devoted to the Strong-Prince.\n"
"\n"
"Jorunn and Fildgor, along with their closest comrades, each arrived in time "
"to see the gates of Windhelm break wide. The brothers fought valiantly, but "
"they couldn't prevent the fall of the city or the death of Queens Mabjaarn "
"and Nurnhilde (\"\"The Brief Queen\"\"), who died defending the palace and "
"the people they loved. The twins, who hadn't been close for several years, "
"nonetheless fell into familiar companionship and joined forces to repel the "
"invaders. Thanks to Jorunn's alliance with the Dark Elves and the unexpected "
"but welcome assistance of the Argonians, the Akaviri invasion was at last "
"crushed.\n"
"\n"
"As Jorunn and his forces returned to Windhelm, Fildgor stepped forward to "
"claim rulership. The crisis was over, and he decided to push his claim. He "
"expected Jorunn to acquiesce, as his brother usually did in the face of "
"Fildgor's anger and unrestrained passion. But Jorunn refused. The Skald "
"Prince decided to become the Skald King, for he had seen what Fildgor's "
"passions were capable of. In war, he wanted Fildgor at his side. But as a "
"leader for his people? Jorunn didn't really want to sit upon the throne, but "
"he felt he had no choice. He didn't believe Fildgor would be a good ruler "
"for his people.\n"
"\n"
"Enraged by Jorunn's defiance, Fildgor rallied the Stormfist clan and other "
"supporters he had throughout the realm. After all, he was a true Nord "
"warrior, not a singer and scholar like his brother. Jorunn saw that the "
"kingdom was headed for civil war, so he challenged Fildgor to single combat. "
"The Strong Prince smiled, confident he could defeat his bard of a brother "
"easily. He accepted, and the longest three hours in recent history began. "
"The brothers' war was on.\n"
"\n"
"The two brothers fought in the square outside the battle-damaged palace. The "
"fight was brutal and long. Weapons clashed, parried, came together, moved "
"apart, and drew blood. When it appeared that neither brother was going to "
"gain the upper hand before they both collapsed from sheer exhaustion, Jorunn "
"called upon reserves no one expected him to possess. He struck Fildgor's "
"weapon, shattering it. Then he knocked Fildgor flat and demanded his "
"surrender.\n"
"\n"
"With no other option available, Fildgor surrendered. But his hatred burned "
"and his rage surrounded him like a roiling storm. With a broken heart, "
"Jorunn exiled his brother and chastened the Stormfist clan for supporting "
"him. Fildgor cursed Jorunn's name and departed. While the Skald King went on "
"to prove himself a capable and beloved ruler, the Strong Prince was rumored "
"to have fled to the lands of the Daggerfall Covenant. Perhaps one day, the "
"brothers' war will resume."
