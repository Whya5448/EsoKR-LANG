"By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n"
"\n"
"If you know anything about Yokudan history, you're aware of the role Prince "
"Hubalajad played—or did not play—in the early days following the initial Ra "
"Gada colonization. We know \"\"Prince Hew\"\" as a comic figure, share tales "
"of his thick-headed approach to impossible problems, and jest about his "
"aggressive opulence. A shrine to Zeht floods as a sign of the god's "
"displeasure? Build a more extravagant one further downstream! An oft-"
"repeated Taneth expression for wasting money is \"\"laying foundation with "
"Hubalajad's coin.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Yet, what is truly known of the Luckless Prince? The only references "
"available are third-hand documents, at best. The many apocryphal tales muddy "
"the issue, drawing us further and further away from the actual man. "
"Therefore, we must look to the land of Hew's Bane itself to draw our own "
"conclusions. What if, for only a moment, we approach what are commonly "
"accepted as his many failures on their own terms?\n"
"\n"
"We know Hubalajad must have arrived in the barren land of what was then "
"called \"\"Khefrem's Boot\"\" with a sizable amount of soldiers and artisans."
" Without local quarries, and with no reliable overland route from the north, "
"they needed to import a mass amount of cut stone by sea. The natural "
"protected harbor in what would become Abah's Landing was undoubtedly their "
"first stop. A steady flow of laden barges would prove tempting to pirates, "
"so Hubalajad's first necessity was to construct No Shira Citadel, an "
"imposing fortress overlooking the Abecean.\n"
"\n"
"It is true No Shira was soon undermined by seasonal flooding. But in "
"response, Hubalajad appealed to Zeht with a shrine. When subsequent flooding "
"washed out the first shrine, he did order the construction of another, yet "
"more elaborate shrine—but from an examination of the stonework, the new one "
"was upstream of the last. Seen in this light, \"\"Prince Hew's thick-"
"headedness\"\" was in fact persistent resolve. Appealing to the Yokudan god "
"of agriculture is not the act of an arrogant or thoughtless man.\n"
"\n"
"All the while, Abah's Landing grew from a soldier's camp and shantytown to a "
"sprawling city. Despite the many hardships of this frontier life, Hubalajad "
"constructed a great palace—a symbol that this land was his home, and that he "
"was just as committed as the locals to thriving. Stone went to the great "
"walls of Abah's Landing, showing that its contents deserved as much "
"protection as the Yokudan ships.\n"
"\n"
"For a moment I ask you to set aside the multiple tombs, the impressive "
"Princes Gate that opened a northern passage to Ra Gada territory, and the "
"Yokudan statue just south of the Abah's Landing harbor that most erroneously "
"believe was an idealized image of Hubalajad himself. The very act of "
"constructing a citadel and a walled city at the same time, with the same "
"pool of resources, would require a sharp mind for logistical matters. If it "
"was not Hubalajad himself, he knew enough to surround himself with someone "
"who could. This is hardly the style of a witless buffoon.\n"
"\n"
"The scale of Hubalajad's setbacks do not, in this author's opinion, justify "
"the tales of endless folly. Was it a whispering campaign from jealous rivals "
"who decried the resources he poured into an inhospitable land? A blemished "
"reputation for not recognizing his half-uncle was a necromancer? Did he "
"invoke the ire of a Yokudan god, or perhaps a Daedric Prince? Though we may "
"never truly know, we should keep one thing in mind about Hubalajad: before "
"his arrival, no Man or Mer left a mark on this land. Today, the only "
"structures surviving two millennia were those constructed by \"\"Prince Hew."

"My inquiries into the whereabouts of your son have finally yielded fruit, "
"but I fear you will find that fruit to be bitter instead of sweet.\n"
"\n"
"I'm sorry to say that your concerns regarding your son were confirmed. He "
"has been linked with a group of skooma addicts who often beg for spare "
"pieces of gold. My contact provided me with the map in this packet. He "
"informs me that before he could approach your son to pass along your "
"message, he was assaulted by two men who argued with him briefly before "
"dragging him away. The young woman who was with your son, a disheveled "
"Breton, disappeared into the marketplace during the commotion.\n"
"\n"
"Following up with the local guards, my contact was able to discern that the "
"two men were bounty hunters from Vvardenfell who had documentation linking "
"Tashmin to a crime, but inquiries with officials in Vvardenfell have turned "
"up no evidence of either a crime or bounty on your son. My fear: These men "
"work for House Dres and plan to return your son to a life of slavery.\n"

"or, \"\"Hard-Earned Tips From Old Sculler\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Some of these nobles … all that money and they still want more. They'll pay, "
"too. But you have to be smart.\n"
"\n"
"You get sent all over Tamriel to grab goods and \"\"clean\"\" them, take a "
"tip from Old Sculler—get it done quick and without getting caught! Paying "
"off your bounty takes away from the profits.\n"
"\n"
"Here's what Old Sculler does:\n"
"\n"
"1. Find the right targets. Somebody wants \"\"ritual objects,\"\" you'll "
"likely find them near cathedrals or on priests. Sounds obvious, right? Well, "
"that means big cities … usually with lots of guards. Pick your targets "
"carefully. Make sure the temple isn't big enough to have its own guards, or "
"if it does that they aren't staring everywhere at once.\n"
"\n"
"2. If you do get a bounty on you, don't be in such a rush. Find something "
"outside the city to do before you try finishing the contract. Old Sculler "
"once made some extra gold helping a village with their bandit problem. "
"Nobody there cared about a bounty. By the time that job was done, the guards "
"had lost interest and Old Sculler turned in her \"\"clean\"\" goods, sweet "
"as you please.\n"
"\n"
"Be smart or be dead."

"Red Eagle's voice, like velvet, pulled me toward the sarcophagus. He urged "
"me to place the blade in the sarcophagus alongside his body. Like my Daedric "
"benefactors, he whispered of power beyond belief, and filled my head with "
"images of us ruling together as I had always imagined. The room continued to "
"press inward, and I felt cushioned and buoyed along as I laid the blade "
"carefully on the ground and grunted through the effort of removing the lid "

"\n"
"I gazed down at the skeletal remains, the dank smell of the tomb wafting up "

"the moment I laid the blade in his grave.\n"
"\n"
"My head was immediately wracked with a blinding pain, and I fell to the "

"I shivered and wrapped my cloak tighter around myself, following the "
"pointing, gnarled finger of the toothless old Reachman, his words croaking "
"out between hearty chuckles at my discomfort. My eyes followed the path into "
"the hills, resting finally on a distant cave entrance, barely visible "
"through the stinging snow, and I steeled myself for the coming trek. Though "
"my physical and mental reserves were nearly spent, I knew that my ambitions "
"were closer than ever to being fulfilled, and despite the lateness of the "
"day and the biting cold, I resolved to reach Red Eagle's tomb on that very "
"night. \n"
"\n"
"Though the powers granted to me by my Daedric benefactors are great, "
"intestinal fortitude was not on the list, and when I reached the mouth of "
"the cave I collapsed, exhausted. As I lay there, without even the vigor to "
"drag myself inside, I began to hear the flittering whispers and distant "
"horns, calling me forth to destiny. With this ghostly music in my ears, I "
"crawled into the mouth of the cave, wrapped all that I had around my frame, "
"and dropped into black, dreamless sleep.\n"
"\n"
"I awoke to the sound of birds and light—things still, as in my youth, "
"repugnant to my senses. I retreated quickly into the darkness of the cave. I "
"knew that my goal was below in the depths. A warm breath pulsed from the "
"interior of the cave, drawing me inward, the thrumming horns seeming to echo "
"from somewhere deep below. I felt a tightness in my chest as I followed "
"these guides, hoping to soon reach my much maligned ancestor.\n"
"\n"
"The traps set to dissuade intruders and grave robbers were child's play for "
"my intellect, and ever cautious I made my way deeper into the crypt. The "
"cave walls pressed in, and gradually the rough, rippled rock walls gave way "
"to hewn stone and chiseled murals. My fingers traced the images, caressing "
"Red Eagle's sword as it cut swathes through a thousand men. The whispering "
"voices and alien horns grew louder, increasing the pressure in my head—my "
"senses lulled, but my mind alert, I knew that soon, after years of research, "
"my ascension was at hand.\n"
"\n"
"I turned one last corner and found myself in Red Eagle's tomb. Simple and "
"unadorned, a sarcophagus sat on a dais in the center of the chamber. Lying "
"near it on a pedestal was Red Eagle's Bane, his magnificent blade. In a "
"burst I ran to it, and hovered over it. My was breath heavy and quick, the "
"voices and music silenced, replaced by an all-encompassing, heavy, ragged, "
"expectant breath.\n"
"\n"
"My hand hovered above the hilt, my fingers grasping and flexing, fear "
"mingling with excitement. Carefully, I reached down and grasped the blade, "
"lifting it up before me and staring, transfixed by the sight.\n"
"\n"
"What came next, my mind almost completely refuses to recall, as memories of "
"such horror must be locked away, lest the brain that contains them be driven "
"mad."

"As a child, I was sickly and morose, a feeble stripling confined to a bed. "
"The greater world came to me primarily through the windows of my room, high "
"in the relative safety of my family's expansive manor. The vivid flashes of "
"light and color that entered my room via its large windows served only to "
"heighten the anxiety and fear of the outside world I had carefully "
"cultivated in my bed rest. With the physical world become a place of fear "
"and tension for my weakened frame, I retreated into the solace of the "
"written word, and plumbed the deep mysteries of Nirn.\n"
"\n"
"While I lived many lives, and learned many things in this way, one "
"particular legend, that of Red Eagle, the king of the Reachmen, lodged "
"itself most firmly in my mind. Though I was the scion of a family of proud "
"Bretons, I contrived a connection between myself and the King of the Reach, "
"Faolan. With this lie embedded in my heart, I turned my studies to the dark "
"arts, wishing to find a way to fulfill Red Eagle's oath, and return him to "
"life. He would, by my machinations, rule The Reach, his flaming sword in one "
"hand, and I at the other, his trusted and beloved vizier.\n"
"\n"
"As I grew, my maladies passed, leaving me weak, but no longer bed-ridden, "
"and the largesse of my family afforded me the ability to discreetly expand "
"my research. My peculiar eccentricities were accepted due to my rank, and "
"the near complete isolation of my youth.\n"
"\n"
"Inevitably, my studies led me to the Daedra. Late at night, in the darkness, "
"deep within my family's manor, I would conduct ancient rituals in unfamiliar "
"tongues, raising the foul demons and trapping them, plying them with "
"questions. Often they would ignore my entreaties, promising me great power "
"or wealth if only I would release them from their magical bonds. Though weak "
"of flesh, my mind was stalwart; I resisted their honeyed words, and "
"eventually they would accept that the only path to freedom lay in "
"acquiescence.\n"
"\n"
"Again and again, this story played out, and in fits and starts I collected "
"the information I desired, but it was never enough. Slowly, their poisoned "
"promises bore fruit, and I convinced myself that perhaps I could outsmart "
"these Oblivion-cursed souls. It was my own hubris that led me to believe I "
"could accept their gifts and yet control the terms.\n"
"\n"
"How naive I was then, and how haunted I am by the truths I know now. The "
"fear of the outside world returned tenfold, I have again taken solace in the "
"solitude of my ancestral manse. Though I search feverishly for an escape, I "
"know in my heart that none will rear its head. There is a darkness that "
"lives in the roots of Nirn, and once envisaged, it can never be escaped."

"I stood, trying to cover Corvus Direnni's \"\"Principles of Conjuration\"\" "
"with a parchment.\n"
"\n"
"The Prince's eyes flashed. \"\"Reading Direnni again, eh? You know how I "
"feel about magic in the palace, Petty-Vizier!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"It … it isn't mine, Your Highness! I confiscated it from Jengesh the "

" \n"
"\"\"Hmph. And why aren't you wearing your official petty-vizier turban?\"\"\n"
" \n"

"\"\"Nonsense, it's the middle of First Seed! But I want to know if "
"preparations for the festival are on schedule. You know how much my people "

" \n"
"I shook my head. \"\"They're Redguards, Your Highness. They don't really go "

" \n"
"\"\"That's about to change! Now, are we prepared for pin-the-tail-on-the-"

" \n"
"\"\"Yes, Your Highness. Or we will be, once Morad gets back from having the "
"splint put on his leg.\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Bobbing for gorapples?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"The tubs, fruit baskets, and towels are all lined up in the west "
"courtyard.\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"The Town Guards' three-legged race?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"I cleared my throat. \"\"Well, there we have a problem, Your Sublimity, "
"because none of the Guards have signed up for the event. They're … "
"reluctant, because they remember how you punished Corporal Zaqudh after last "
"year's race.\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"He was cheating! I had to punish him! And after all, he still has most "
"of his toes.\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Even so, I don't believe they'll do it.\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Hmph.\"\" The Prince tugged on his moustache irritably. \"\"What if you "
"can assure them that I know they won't cheat by untying their legs, because "
"they won't be able to?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"This was bad. It meant the Prince had had an idea, and it was always bad "
"when the Prince had an idea. \"\"What do you mean, 'won't be able to'?\"\" I "
"asked warily.\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Ha ha! Dhorlun, come in here,\"\" he called. His bodyguard ducked his "
"head under the lintel and came in from the hallway. \"\"Hafzi, stand in "
"front of that Yokudan urn,\"\" Prince Hew said. \"\"Dhorlun, stand next to "
"the Petty-Vizier.\"\"\n"
" \n"
"I shrugged, and we took our positions, Big Dhorlun at my side, topping my "
"height by a head and a half. Prince Hew raised his hands in an arcane "
"gesture and I realized, to my horror, that he was about to try to cast a "
"spell—but before I could protest, it was done. The spell was invoked, the "
"magicka surged over me, and I felt my left leg weld itself to Dhorlun's "
"right. \"\"No!\"\" I cried. \"\"Highness, what have you done?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"The Prince gave his moustache a self-satisfied twirl. \"\"Did you think you "
"were the only one who could read Corvus Direnni, Hafzi? I stripped the "
"binding clause out of Koron's Peremptory Summons, and discovered I could use "
"it to bind other things than the will of a Daedra! Impressive, isn't it?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"I just gaped at him. Meanwhile, Big Dhorlun looked down at our magically-"
"bound legs, grunted, and then tried to step forward. I had to grab his arm "
"to keep from falling over, and even then I nearly dragged both of us down. "
"Dhorlun shook his head. \"\"This is bad, Master. Don't like it. Make it go "
"away, Master.\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Oh, very well. Unbind!\"\" the Prince said, and reversed the spell, but "
"added an inadvisable gestural flourish that funneled far too much magicka "
"into it. Dhorlun and I flew apart, hurled to opposite sides of the room, and "
"the ancient Yokudan urn behind us shattered explosively.\n"
" \n"
"Suddenly a swirling cloud appeared above the shattered jar, and a hollow, "
"ringing voice cried, \"\"Free! FREE! After an eon bound in that stinking "
"jug, I'm free!\"\" The cloud rapidly coalesced into an armored floating "
"torso with a helmed head and four arms, each of which gripped a huge "
"scimitar. \"\"Now I take my vengeance on the world of mortals!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"The scimitars began to whirl menacingly. I glanced at Dhorlun, but he'd gone "
"head-first into my marble bust of Morwha and was still stunned. "
"\"\"Highness!\"\" I cried. \"\"Use your spell! Bind that thing before it "
"chops us into hors-d'oeuvres!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"Prince Hew's eyes goggled with horror. \"\"I c-can't! The unbinding spell "
"drained all my magicka! It's up to you, Hafzi!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"I ducked as two scimitars whistled over my head, and dashed behind my desk. "
"The thing was between me and the door—it WAS up to me to bind it, but I "
"hadn't cast a spell in months. Prince Hew shrieked as a scimitar slashed the "
"tassels off his golden fez. \"\"Koron's Prison, Hafzi! It's our only "
"chance!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"But that needs a container, and the urn is smashed!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Use this!\"\" And the Prince tossed me the magenta-and-green petty-"
"vizier turban.\n"
" \n"
"Three scimitars came down on my desk, smashing it to flinders, as I inverted "
"the turban and cast Koron's Perdurable Prison. \"\"NOOO!\"\" the demon cried "
"as it dwindled into the hated hat. \"\"I loathe the scent of hair oil…!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"And then it was gone. I was still trembling, but Prince Hew blinked, took a "
"deep breath, and smiled. \"\"Well, that didn't end so badly, did it? At "
"least, not as bad as the Iron Regatta, or that business with the pet toku "
"gava! Now, where were we?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"I helped Big Dhorlun up out of the marble dust of the shattered statue. "
"\"\"We were canceling the Guards' three-legged race, remember?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"I suppose you're right, Hafzi. You usually are.\"\" He brightened. \"\"I "
"have it! After the gorapple bobbing contest, we'll have them use their "
"crossbows to shoot the fruit off the heads of the losers! Oh, and … just get "
"rid of that turban.\"\""

"since his attempt to learn the Water Breathing spell had left him "
"temporarily unable to breathe anything but water. (I'd told him he was "
"inverting the fifth and sixth syllables, but he'd ignored me.) \"\"Are the "
"skeevers into the oats again?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Nope!\"\" Jengesh smiled slyly. \"\"You'll have to see this for yourself."
"\"\"\n"
" \n"
"Prince Hew was pacing impatiently back and forth before the door to the "
"stables, taking care to keep his curly-toed golden slippers out of the dung. "
"\"\"Ah! There you are, Hafzi! I have something to show you—and this time I "
"know you'll be impressed!\"\" He waved one silk-clad arm toward his ever-"
"present bodyguard, and Big Dhorlun slid the stable door open on its rollers.\n"
" \n"
"Inside was the ugliest thing I'd ever seen. It looked like a Ra Gada war "
"chariot, but it was oversized, with four wheels instead of two, and with a "
"big gold-fringed umbrella on a gilded frame over the rider's box. The box "
"itself was garishly painted with glowing rainbows, the Prince's chosen "
"symbol (\"\"Because I'm 'Prince Hue'—get it?\"\"), and silver spatter-boards "
"were mounted over the wheels to keep mud from besmirching the driver. The "
"whole affair looked as heavy as an oxcart in a quarry.\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Isn't it glorious?\"\" the Prince asked. \"\"It's glorious, isn't "
"it?\"\" he repeated, pointedly. \"\"Glorious.\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"G-glorious. Yes, indeed. Exactly.\"\" I said. \"\"It's also … rather "
"large. But it looks to me like it would take about eight horses to draw it, "
"and right now we have only six.\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Horses? Pfah! Horses are for the ordinary! My new princely chariot will "
"be drawn by … a haj mota!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"A devil-tortoise? But no one's ever tamed one—it can't be done. And "
"where would Your Highness get it, anyway?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"I have one already!\"\" said Prince Hew, proudly twirling his handlebar "
"moustache. \"\"I bought it from a Bosmeri merchant, who tamed it with "
"soporific bug-smoke. Come see!\"\" And he led the way further into the "
"stable.\n"
" \n"
"That's when the screaming began. Normally I wouldn't use a hoary cliche like "
"\"\"blood-curdling shrieks,\"\" but really, my heart froze at the sound, "
"terrible wails from both humans and horses. Morad the stable-hand came "
"running from the pens, wide-eyed, followed by a Wood Elf I didn't recognize. "
"I got in his way, and when he tried to push past me I grabbed him by one of "
"his cosmetic antlers. \"\"Ow! Stop it, lady! Run for it!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Tell me what happened, and I'll let you go,\"\" I snarled, twisting the "
"antler for emphasis.\n"
" \n"
"\"\"It's the haj mota! It must've gotten used to the sleep-smoke, because it "
"woke up—mad!\"\" He looked over his shoulder, trembling. \"\"It's eating the "
"horses! And we're next—let me go!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"I let him go. And then, out of the depths of the barn, came the thundering "
"devil-tortoise, its jaws still dripping gobbets of horse. It was charging "
"straight toward Prince Hew, who stood stock-still, watching it. I realized "
"he was paralyzed with fear.\n"
" \n"
"I barely made it, but I tackled the Prince and knocked him out of the way "
"just before the haj mota would have trampled him. It passed us, then stopped "
"short and turned—it was shockingly nimble—and whacked Dhorlun with its heavy "
"tail, sending him flying in one direction, and his two-handed sword in "
"another. Then it focused on us, murder in its red, piggy eyes.\n"
" \n"
"I was sprawled atop Prince Hew, who was pawing at me with his pudgy hands "
"and bleating, \"\"Save me, Hafzi! Save me!\"\" As the thing stepped closer "
"and opened its great beak I tried to think of a spell, any spell, but with "
"the Prince wheezing at me my mind was a blank.\n"
" \n"
"The Prince … wheezing …. Suddenly a spell formed in my mind, I blurted it "
"out, and slapped the haj mota on its nose. Magicka poured from me and into "
"the beast, which blinked, snorted, and began to shake its head left and "
"right. It opened its jaws wide and burst out in great, wracking gasps, and "
"then flung its legs out and flopped down, lungs heaving. In less than a "
"minute it was dead, suffocated.\n"
" \n"
"Because it couldn't find any water to breathe.\n"
" \n"
"I helped the Prince up, dusting off his silken robes, except for the part "
"where he'd sat in horse dung, which I pretended not to notice. \"\"What … "
"what happened to it, Hafzi?\"\" he said. His eyes narrowed. \"\"You didn't "
"use any magic on it, did you?\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"It … must have been a delayed reaction to the bug-smoke. A breathing "
"problem!\"\" I nodded emphatically. \"\"Yes, it must have been the smoke. "
"Remember the time I wore that Rihad musk and you couldn't stop sneezing? "
"Like that!\"\"\n"
" \n"
"\"\"Ah. Yes. Well, that was lucky, wasn't it? Dhorlun, run after that "
"merchant and get my money back! I'm going to have to buy another six horses."
"\"\" He looked fondly at the hideous chariot. \"\"Maybe eight!\"\""

"Wayrest offered few options. The sale of the chub loons recovered some of "
"our fortunes, but not enough to make it worth the annoyance. We bought a "
"leaky ship, and sought some cargo to sell on the coast as we returned to our "
"homeland. I, Zabia-ko, did not truly trust the broker at the docks, and I "
"declined most of his schemes.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"But Zabia-ko, you must trade in delicacies!\"\" the scoundrel said, "
"\"\"Sugars and rice will only earn you so much, but dreugh eggs packed in "
"mud are prized by the rich, fat merchants of Abah's Landing!\"\" At the time "
"it seemed worth the risk.\n"
"\n"
"It was not. Dreugh, who shed their legs after mating and spend their lives "
"in the sea, must have sensed the eggs in the hull, for they attacked our "
"ship soon after leaving Sentinel. They rushed in with the water when the "
"ship cracked open, and took the eggs. This one lost consciousness before the "
"ship broke apart completely.\n"
"\n"
"Fear not! This was not the end of Zabia-ko. There are still many more "
"stories to tell and creatures to see, like the fascinating sep adder. To "
"that in a moment.\n"
"\n"
"We awoke on a beach in the south-west portion of the land of Hew's Bane, a "
"short journey by land from Abah's Landing. The journey to the city saw many "
"adventures, including an encounter with an Orc who thinks she's a shark, but "
"the best part was the winged snake called by locals as the sep adder.\n"
"\n"
"Like the chub loon, it is a silly thing to behold. It has no legs, yet moves "
"around the ground like a snake. It has wings, yet cannot truly fly. Unlike "
"the stupid birds, however, the sep adder manages to thrive and be graceful. "
"It always has a means of satiating its ever-present hunger.\n"
"\n"
"It is constantly on the prowl for its next meal, gliding along the lush "
"shores of the land's rivers, picking bugs out of the sky and fish from the "
"water. Later, as the land grew dry and the water less common, I saw more of "
"them, plucking small mice from their little arid homes in the ground. \n"
"\n"
"It should be good at none of these things, but it is good at many things. It "
"lives in the wet lands and dry. It is like Zabia-ko. This one was not born "
"into money nor especially lucky, but through wit, is able to overcome many "
"misfortunes.\n"
"\n"
"The people of this land honor the sep adder, for when approaching Abah's "
"Landing, we saw a great statue of a man wrapped in a giant snake with wings. "
"I never saw one that large, but that's not to say they don't exist in the "
"wilderness. If such a creature can overcome and be honored in such a "
"triumphant way, maybe, too, Zabia-ko can overcome and find a place of honor "
"somewhere. Even if it's only the honor of knowing where her next meal is "
"coming from!"

"know my thinking on this subject. Better safe than sorry, as the Dark Elves "

"\n"
"I've suggested in my previous reports that there was another group or "

"suddenly coming on the scene to challenge the merchant lords after a century "
"of only having to deal with themselves. Within twenty-five years, the Shadow "
"Conglomerate had risen to a place of prominence that allowed it to actually "
"cause the merchant houses to step back and concede a portion of their power "
"and influence to this new and secret organization.\n"
"\n"
"I believe a battle of some sort took place in the deepest shadows. In this "
"battle, the hidden house emerged victorious while the public-facing merchant "
"houses were grievously wounded and forced off the pedestals they had raised "
"themselves upon. The worse casualty was Gurges and Associates, which stopped "
"being an active concern almost overnight and has since become known as "
"\"\"the Fallen House.\"\"\n"

"Now I want to tell you about the sad and unfortunate fate of the fourth "
"major merchant house of Abah's Landing, an organization I like to call, "
"\"\"the Fallen House.\"\" Gurges and Associates dates back to a powerful and "
"important Imperial family that has all but disappeared from the Cyrodiil "
"records. It came to prominence during the rise of the merchant lords of "
"Hew's Bane, when Isobel Gurges—known as the Regal Pirate of the "
"Abecean—retired from raiding and pillaging to form a more or less legitimate "
"business.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, legitimate business means something very different in a place "
"like Abah's Landing. Isobel began by making loans with exorbitant interest "
"rates, but it wasn't long before she took Gurges and Associates into "
"gambling, fencing, laundering, and highjacking (where she had her crews "
"steal cargo from merchant vessels so they could sell it back to those same "
"merchants for an immediate profit).\n"
"\n"
"When the merchant house crisis rocked Abah's Landing fifteen years prior, "
"Gurges and Associates was nearly bankrupted. The tumult since, as well as "
"events leading up to the Three Banners War, all but spelled the doom of the "
"merchant house. Today, the Gurges family has only a handful of blood members "
"and vassals, leaving its current patriarch, Martinus Gurges, a bitter and "
"jealous man. He has plans, however. Plans to rebuild his company, reclaim "
"his fortune and holdings, and once again make the Gurges name something to "
"be honored and respected, if not feared, in Abah's Landing. He has a long "

"On the S'virash Sahaala\n"
"\n"
"The \"\"Chase Away\"\" song is one of the three Dusk-Canticles that fell "
"from the tongue of Azurah in the Dawn Time. Like the Twilight Lady herself, "
"the \"\"Chase Away\"\" song is slippery and unpredictable. It should not be "
"sung unless the need is great.\n"
"\n"
"In ancient times it was used to treat disease and ward off cane-locusts. But "
"then came the Middle-Dawn that twisted the Moon Bishops' tails and made them "
"forgetful. Now it is only used to drive out the dro-m'Athra.\n"
"\n"
"The dro-m'Athra dance to no music but the beating Heart of Lorkhaj. It is a "
"song without song—dark and seductive. The heartbeat is a lie that repeats "
"and repeats until it becomes truth to the cat who hears it. When a Khajiit "
"accepts the will of Lorkhaj as truth, they forget the Riddle'Thar and become "
"Lost Cats. Khajiit that are well and truly bent cannot be saved through "
"song, they can only be banished with knives and moonlight. Cats that still "
"struggle against the Heart, however, can be drawn back from the Darks.\n"
"\n"
"The S'virash Sahaala's strength lies in its elusiveness. The Clan Mothers "
"will tell you to sing no songs in the presence of the dro-m'Athra, and they "
"are wise to do so. Heedless singing will draw you closer to the Heart. Your "
"song will fall in with the beat, your tail will twitch in time, and you will "
"slide into the Maw of Lorkhaj whisker-first. The \"\"Chase Away\"\" song is "
"the only song that can break the Heart's tempo. The notes dance up and down "
"the scale like a mad shadow, confusing the Darks and making the Heart weak "
"and sluggish. Eventually the tempo will break and the corruption will pass.\n"
"\n"
"Even so, those who sing the S'virash Sahaala take a great risk. The dro-"
"m'Athra hate Azurah's hymns and will take great pains to kill any cat who "
"sings them. So take heed, Cantor—if you confront Namiira's dark litter, you "
"must move swiftly and keep your wits. A moment's weakness can end in "
"disaster."

"When the merchant houses of Abah's Landing were first established, one stood "
"out from the rest. Significant not only for its unusual leader, but for the "
"type of business she decided to trade in. The Khajiit who called herself "
"Thazahrr-ra formed the Thazahrr Cartel to handle the despicable but "
"necessary slave trade moving through the port city. The powerful Thazahrr-"
"ra, one of only a few women in Khajiit history to take the male honorific "
"\"\"ra\"\" as her own, formed a cartel that included Imperials, Bretons, "
"Redguards, and a few Khajiit. \n"
"\n"
"How could a Khajiit run a slavery cartel? Quite handily, it turns out. The "
"legend of Thazahrr-ra grew as fast as the fortunes of the Cartel, describing "
"a woman who would sell her own children if the profit was high enough. In "
"addition to processing Argonian and Khajiit slaves on their way to distant "
"lands, the Cartel expanded into the areas of smuggling and buying and "
"selling information. Make no mistake: Being willing to sell your own people "
"makes the Cartel extremely dangerous, as many of their competitors "
"discovered over the years.\n"
"\n"
"Today, Thazahrr Goldfang, the sixth Khajiit woman to take the name and title "
"of merchant lord of the Thazahrr Cartel, oversees the house's businesses. "
"She appears restless and unhappy with the state of the houses in Abah's "
"Landing, and with the state of her business in general. Whatever occurred to "
"hinder all of the merchant houses seems to have hit the Cartel harder than "
"most. She longs to return her organization to the position of power and "
"prestige it enjoyed in the days before the activities of the \"\"hidden "
"house\"\" so that she can claim the same honorific as her esteemed ancestor.\n"
"\n"
"Thazahrr Goldfang bubbles over with anger and ambition. She feels that "
"Abah's Landing owes her a level of wealth and respect that, frankly, it has "
"no intention of awarding her with. For this reason, she remains frustrated, "
"anxious, and more than a little dangerous. My recommendation? Do not "

"Vazshara has only been a Doubting Monk for a week, and already she is "

"It's like there is a great big senche-tiger eating our dinner, but we're "

"Darks here and let the dro-m'Athra into Nirni. But why? How? No one will say."

"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"Vazshara claws are cramped from writing! This one has spoken to many, many "
"monks and committed their stories to paper. Vazshara has to admit, these "
"tales are much darker than the ones she learned as a ja'khajiit. The players "
"are always the same: crazy monks and a Moon Bishop called the \"\"Stone-"
"Tapper.\"\" Apparently, this bishop carried a magic stick that spoke secrets "
"when he tapped it on the floor. No one knows where this magic stick came "
"from, or where it went after the Moon Bishop died, so it might be Senche "
"dung. But one mystery at a time, yes?\n"
"\n"
"Day and night, this Moon Bishop tapped the floor, learning all of Nirni's "
"secrets. But eventually the magic stick ran out of Nirni-secrets, so it "
"started telling darker secrets. Namiira-secrets. The Tapper listened and "
"listened, growing old and crazy. The monks of the temple went crazy too, "
"because the tapping never stopped. It was a loud and steady sound—tap-tap, "
"tap-tap, tap-tap. Like a heartbeat, yes? Eventually, the monks hatched a "
"plot to kill the Stone-Tapper. They lured him into the High Lunarium and "
"stabbed him with their curved knives until he died. All the blood and "
"secrets drained out of the Tapper's body and broke open the temple, "
"revealing the Maw of Lorkhaj, and the Darks beyond.\n"
"\n"
"This is where the tale starts to fray. In some versions of the story, The "
"Tapper wakes up after his blood is drained and kills all the monks with "
"lightning. In others, a great winged beast bursts out of Lorkhaj's throat "
"and rips the monks apart with claws and fangs. But this makes no sense. The "
"seals scattered throughout the temple clearly show the Moon Bishop flanked "
"by monks and summoning bent spirits. And this one has seen what looks like a "
"door in the High Lunarium. So he must have survived, and he must have pushed "
"at least some of the monks into the Bent Dance, right? Bah. This one thinks "
"it might be a guilty conscience. The Doubting Monks have a sour reputation. "
"Many Khajiit think the order played a role in freeing the dro-m'Athra. This "
"one is starting to think they may be right. Vazshara should have listened to "
"her papa and become a fisherman. Var var var.\n"

"today and gave her the worst tongue-lashing of her life. \"\"No more loose "

"This temple is a tomb. No one laughs, or sings, or dances. It's nothing but "

"to make Vazshara run away, but there is more. There was something in the "
"Abbot's eyes. It wasn't rage—no, it wasn't that. It was like … nothing. Like "
"a dull black nothing. Like a dead cat's eyes. It made this one's tail knot "

"It was inevitable. A den of vice and corruption such as Abah's Landing "

"Lady Felice Vien, who arrived in Abah's Landing from Wayrest with her "
"dignity, a cask full of gold, and the intention to make a place for herself "
"amid the debauchery and depravity of the port city. Very little information "

"Wayrest, and her alleged role in his death.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever the situation that sent her to Abah's Landing, Lady Felice wasted "
"no time purchasing property and establishing the Winsome Welwa, a tavern and "
"inn that soon became the talk of the port. What started as a humble eatery "
"and fest hall began offering other entertainments, entertainments of the "
"less than legal kind. Lady Felice saw that the people moving through Abah's "
"Landing had particular vices, and she knew that there was gold to be made if "
"she could satisfy their needs.\n"
"\n"
"Today, House Vien handles the more intimate and discreet demands of Abah's "
"Landing, including illicit substances, prostitution, and other vices. The "
"Winsome Welwa, modeled after the infamous Chaste Harpy in Highrock, serves "
"as a brothel and the base of operations for the current head of the house, "
"Lady Ylanie Montaine. Despite the calamity that befell all of the merchant "
"houses, she continues to make a modest profit administering to the illicit "
"needs of pirates, merchant crews, and visiting nobles looking for a bit of "
"adventure. All of the house's trade is focused on Abah's Landing, all under "
"the Lady's discerning eye. She presents a proper, genteel countenance when "

"dignitaries, but she has a violent, even murderous, temper—though few who "
"have the misfortune to see that side of her live to tell the tale.\n"

"The first and, according to the scions of the house, the greatest of the "
"merchant houses of Abah's Landing is the at-Addin Syndicate. Founded by "
"Afshuur at-Addin, a Redguard male known for both his physical prowess and "
"his disarming charm, the Syndicate grew and flourished for almost one-"
"hundred-and-twenty years. The enterprising Afshuur started out as a simple "
"arms dealer, buying, selling, and trading Redguard swords, Orc axes, and "
"Wood Elf bows. His first customers were the pirates and privateers that used "
"Abah's Landing as a port of call on their trips to more prominent locations, "
"but it wasn't long before he was making shipping deals with those very same "
"vessels and their crews.\n"
"\n"
"As time passed, the Syndicate added armor and shields to its inventory, "
"seeking to provide a one-stop shopping destination for anyone in need of "
"protection or those interested in sailing into battle. Pirate crews, "
"mercenary bands, and even privateers in service to one flag or another were "
"clamoring for armor and weapons with the Syndicate seal of quality and "
"assurance. These connections led to another lucrative profit line—the "
"Syndicate began serving as a broker for mercenary contracts. \n"
"\n"
"The current leader of the Syndicate, Orahan at-Addin, rules the business "
"with an iron fist. Ruthless and brilliant, the Redguard male treats every "
"negotiation as a battle, every competition as a war. In fact, war has become "
"at-Addin's primary avenue of trade, which allows him to keep the family "
"enterprise profitable even in the wake of the unrevealed calamity that "
"befell each of the merchant houses recently. As my queen is well aware, the "
"machinations of the unknown party I have dubbed \"\"the hidden house\"\" "
"continue to be evident while also continuing to elude me. I will have "
"answers, I just don't know when I will have them.\n"
"\n"
"Orahan at-Addin deals in arms and armaments, mercenary contracts, and "
"smuggling supplies to all sides of any given conflict. He has no trouble "
"selling weapons to the Covenant, armor to the Pact, and vital supplies to "
"the Dominion—as long as each side has the gold to pay for his services. With "
"the sudden absence of the power that had held the merchant houses in check "
"and had even weakened them with a masterful yet secret attack, the Syndicate "
"has begun to make moves to put it back into a position of power in Abah's "
"Landing.\n"
"\n"
"Regardless of other concerns, I recommend caution when dealing with Orahan "
"and his family. But make no mistake, you will have to deal with them if you "
"plan to make a move on Hew's Bane and Abah's Landing.\n"

"Prepared by Tamonir, Master of Secrets for the Queen of Taneth\n"
"\n"
"Grandiose. Arrogant. Self-important. All these words and more can be used to "
"describe the self-styled merchant lords of Abah's Landing. The four "
"mercantile houses began to take shape about one-hundred-and-sixty years ago. "
"They began as legitimate businesses, working to elevate Abah's Landing and "
"create a center for trade and commerce between High Rock and Valenwood. But "
"Hew's Bane has never been cooperative to those who tried to carve "
"civilization out of the wilderness and, despite their best efforts, each "
"mercantile house slowly became more corrupt as the pursuit of illegal "
"profits quickly outdistanced more above-board enterprises.\n"
"\n"
"The four houses emerged as the at-Addin Syndicate, House Vien, the Thazahrr "
"Cartel, and Gurges and Associates. In time, the lords of these four houses "
"controlled almost all of the commerce and gold flowing through the port "
"city—both legitimate trade and illicit activities. Most of their profits "
"came from smuggling, slavery, and other unlawful transactions. The merchant "
"lords supplied Abah's Landing with goods and services while also "
"establishing lucrative (if modest) trading partnerships in distant lands. As "
"fortunes grew in Abah's Landing, it wasn't long before other groups began to "
"take an interest in the area. This began a long and tumultuous relationship "
"between the merchant lords and local criminals and crime bosses. Indeed, "
"rumors of a \"\"hidden\"\" merchant house even began to circulate, and "
"evidence abounds of a covert war being fought among the houses and the so-"
"called \"\"hidden house.\"\" While I have not been able to uncover any "
"details concerning this conflict, the outcome can clearly be seen. Gurges "
"and Associates was shattered and the other three houses were reduced to pale "
"shadows of their former glory as a clandestine power emerged as the "
"controlling interest in the port city.\n"
"\n"
"For the last fifteen years or so, the merchant houses took a step back. Oh, "
"they continued to engage in business and provide funds to support city "
"services, including guards and infrastructure, but they no longer showed the "
"swagger and bravado that exemplified their behavior for the decades prior to "
"that time. Though no mayor or merchant house or secret guild took center "
"stage, it appears evident to me that someone or something has influenced "
"Abah's Landing from the deepest shadows. For this reason, I urge caution "
"when dealing with Hew's Bane.\n"
"\n"
"In my next report, I'll begin to provide background on each of the prominent "
"merchant houses operating in the area.\n"
"\n"
"(NOTE: These dispatches were \"\"recovered\"\" from a Taneth vessel and "
"delivered to an interested party in Abah's Landing. I have published them so "
"we may all know what our cousins across the bay think of us. —Anonymous)"

"\"\"Well, it definitely looks like murder to me,\"\" Investigator Vale said "
"as she approached the old wooden bridge. \"\"I've found that decapitation is "
"hard to accomplish as a suicide.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The bridge spanned a nondescript waterway just outside the town. There was "
"nothing special or unusual about the bridge or the minor river it spanned, "
"but this is where the town's mayor and his entourage had brought the "
"inspector just the same. Nothing unusual, that is, except for the severed "
"head perched neatly atop the handrail that ran along the right side of the "
"bridge.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You barely looked at the poor creature,\"\" Jakard Herrick, the mayor's "
"trusted confidant and the town's leading merchant said. \"\"How in the name "
"of Oblivion can you make such a bold assertion?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Because I'm that good,\"\" Vale said, continuing to examine the scene of "
"the crime. \"\"That is why the mayor hired me, after all.\"\" She pointed "
"out some of her observations to the mayor and his entourage, including that "
"the lack of blood and a body indicated that the murder didn't occur on the "
"bridge.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Does anyone recognize this unfortunate High Elf?\"\" Vale asked as she "
"stepped over and bent down to better examine the head. It was clearly an "
"older Elf, a male, with perfectly groomed hair and a serene expression on "
"his face. He'd look absolutely peaceful, Vale thought, if not for the ragged "
"scraps of skin and bone protruding from the hole beneath his neck.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"That's Glanonir the gold lender,\"\" the cute young guard that had "
"accompanied them to the bridge blurted out helpfully. \"\"I'd know that smug "
"face anywhere.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The mayor gave her a hard look for talking out of turn, but didn't press the "
"matter. \"\"So, investigator,\"\" he said, turning his attention back to "
"Vale, \"\"can you tell us what happened here?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Indubitably,\"\" Vale said with a smile, taking one more quick look "
"around the area. \"\"It's as clear as, well, the nose on your face, Mayor "
"Moorcroft. Or perhaps I should say, the nose on his face.\"\" She indicated "
"Herrick the merchant with a nod of her head.\n"
"\n"
"Herrick coughed and stammered, \"\"Just—just what are you implying, "
"Inspector Vale?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Vale gave Herrick her most dazzling smile. \"\"I haven't made any "
"implications. Yet.\"\" She plucked something from the victim's hair and then "
"bent down and removed something that was stuck in the gore pooled on the "
"handrail under the victim's neck. She looked at both items, sniffed them "
"each in turn, and spun triumphantly toward the mayor.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"This,\"\" Inspector Vale said, holding up the first item, \"\"is "
"obviously stinkhorn. Our dead gold lender had a number of stems in his hair, "
"which I'm certain led the troll right to him.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"She held up the second item. \"\"This is a black tea leaf. I found it in the "
"gold lender's drippings. Black tea. That's one of your primary commodities, "
"isn't that right Herrick?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The merchant, sweat beading on his forehead, swallowed with an audible gulp "
"and began to step away from the bridge. The cute young guard deftly stepped "
"into his path, her hand pointedly resting on the pommel of her sword.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Explain yourself plainly, Inspector Vale,\"\" the mayor said, clearly "
"dismayed.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Ah, yes,\"\" Vale sighed. \"\"I forget that not everyone sees the world "
"as clearly as I do. Jakard Herrick owed a great debt to the gold lender. "
"More than he could hope to repay, as the black tea crop was pitiful this "
"season. He had noticed the troll that was lurking under this bridge and "
"decided to use it to take care of his problem. He convinced Glanonir to meet "
"him at the bridge, where he unceremoniously dumped a sack full of stinkhorn "
"stems over his head and pushed him into the river. The troll emerged, ripped "
"off the gold lender's head, and dragged the rest under the bridge. You'll "
"find what remains of poor Glanonir, as well as a sleeping troll with a full "
"stomach, right beneath our feet.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"That's … that's nonsensical!\"\" the merchant exclaimed.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"No, that's irrefutable,\"\" Vale said smugly. \"\"Black tea leaves, the "
"same as those still stuck to your sleeves, Herrick. From working in your "
"storehouse, I'm certain.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Shall I throw this miscreant in the dungeon, Mayor Moorcroft?\"\" the "
"cute young guard asked as she lavished the investigator with a smile.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Of course you should, my dear,\"\" Vale said, taking the mayor by the "
"arm. \"\"And then you should summon some more guards, or you'll never get "
"that troll out from under your bridge. Now, come along, Mayor Moorcroft. We "
"really should discuss my fee ….\"\""

"\n"
"Bypassing Tu'wacca's Pillars is the first matter. Why else would there be a "

"trusted advisors surrounding her; Nishka and Puntru. They both knew, this "
"would be their final battle. This would be the fight that would open the "
"gates of life or death for both of them.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Clearly this means that each of the generals stood in the center of their "

"flames? Directions? All of this may be vital.\n"
"\n"
"I should keep my eyes open for anything that would indicate an order when "
"paired with this phrase of text. Something in the room must hint at this. An "
"order or a number? Something. I feel good about this. That treasure will be "

"Young Iori spent her nights listening to her grandfather's stories about the "
"ancient dragons and her days searching the nearby swamps for signs of the "
"legendary creatures. Once she brought back a bright, shiny scale she was "
"convinced belonged to a dragon. Her grandmother said it was nothing but a "
"piece of wamasu hide and cuffed her for going too far away from the house.\n"
"\n"
"But that didn't discourage Iori. She wanted to find a dragon, so she kept "
"searching. Iori strayed further and further from her grandparents' hut "
"until, one day, she got caught in a rainstorm. She took cover in a nearby "
"cave but found the floor full of brackish water. Picking her way around the "
"pool, Iori made it to the back of the cave and came upon something she'd "
"never expected to see—a large, green egg!\n"
"\n"
"The egg, half-buried in warm mud, pulsed with life. Iori knew it had to be a "
"dragon egg. All her grandpa's stories said dragon eggs were big, and hard, "
"and warm. This egg was very, very warm.\n"
"\n"
"And it was alone. There was no sign of the mother dragon, or anyone else. "
"Iori knew if the egg hatched now, there would be no one to take care of the "
"baby dragon and it would die.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I can't bring it back home,\"\" she said. \"\"Gram'll want to smash it, "
"or cook it!\"\" Her gram didn't believe in dragons and eggs, in her world, "
"were food.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I can't stay here, either,\"\" she thought about the hiding she'd get if "
"she came back after dark. \"\"What am I going to do?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Iori sat and thought while the rain poured down. \"\"The storm's getting "
"worse,\"\" she thought. \"\"I can't go back now—I'll just get lost or sick. "
"Gram'll understand.\"\" And, so, Iori convinced herself she should stay "
"overnight. And she did.\n"
"\n"
"The next morning, Iori woke to the sun shining in the cave mouth. She was "
"famished, as hungry as she'd ever been, but her first thoughts were of the "
"egg. Iori dug it out of its warm, mud nest and examined it. The egg was hot!\n"
"\n"
"\"\"It must be just ready to hatch!\"\" she exclaimed. But almost as if in "
"answer, she heard a growl from outside the cave. \"\"Maybe that's the mother "
"dragon?\"\" she thought. But the thought of being trapped in a dragon cave "
"didn't make her feel good at all.\n"
"\n"
"Iori heard the growl again, followed by sniffing. It wasn't a dragon "
"outside! It was a guar! Picking up the egg with one hand and a stone with "
"the other, Iori crept out of the cave. There, she saw a wild guar, nose to "
"the ground. It saw her and sniffed.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You can't have it!\"\" Iori exclaimed, throwing the rock at the guar. It "
"hit the creature right in the nose, hard enough to make it yelp. But this "
"guar wasn't like the tame ones back home. She'd never heard a tame one "
"snarl, and this one started pawing at the ground angrily.\n"
"\n"
"Iori ran. The guar chased her a little way and the young girl grew "
"frightened. She clutched the egg to her chest, protecting it from the tree "
"branches and the occasional fall. She ran long after the guar gave up "
"chasing her, she was so frightened. Eventually, when Iori was too tired to "
"run anymore, she fell to her knees.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I think we're safe, little dragon,\"\" she said—but then gasped in "
"horror. She looked down at the egg and there was a crack! \"\"Oh, no!\"\" "
"Iori wailed. She must have held it too tight, or let a branch hit it. Or—\n"
"\n"
"Another crack appeared, and then another. The shell started to fall away, "
"being pushed from the inside.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You're hatching!\"\" Iori said. She looked around wildly, not sure what "
"to do. She stooped to put the egg down but then hesitated—what if the dragon "
"ran away? But she didn't want to hurt it, either, so she sat cross-legged "
"and made a hammock out of her dirty apron. Iori put the egg in her lap.\n"
"\n"
"It continued to shake and break and, soon, a dragon's nose poked out of the "
"hole! It was bright green and a bit slimy-looking, but the eyes opened and "
"looked up at her. A forked tongue licked out of the wedge-shaped head and "
"Iori felt a rush of excitement. The dragon was hatching!\n"
"\n"
"The rest of the egg broke away, but Iori was surprised to see the "
"\"\"dragon\"\" had no claws—no feet or legs of any kind. It was a snake, but "
"a snake with tiny wings. Most of her friends would've been horrified, "
"holding a baby snake in their laps, but Iori was amazed. She'd heard stories "
"of dragons, but never a snake with wings!\n"
"\n"
"After the creature struggled free of its shell, Iori carefully discarded the "
"shards and put her hands around the winged snake. It was a bit cold, but she "
"felt it grow warmer as it snuggled up in her hands. With sleeping, serpent's "
"eyes, the creature looked up at Iori. It blinked twice, then fell asleep.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Well, you're almost a dragon, aren't you?\"\""
