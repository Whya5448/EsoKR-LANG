"So many people simply buy the items they need at the price they are given. "
"It's a sad state of affairs, when the game is really open to all, you don't "
"need an invitation. It is a game: the game of bargaining to be played "
"seriously and, I hasten to add, politely. In Elsweyr, it is common for the "
"shop owner to offer the prospective buyer tea or sweetmeats and engage in "
"polite conversation before commencing business. This eminently civilized "
"tradition has a practical purpose, allowing the buyer to observe the wares "
"for sale. It is considered impolite not to accept, though it does not imply "
"obligation on the part of the buyer.\n"
"\n"
"Whether this particular custom is part of the culture or not, it's wise for "
"the buyer and seller to greet one another with smiles and warm salutations, "
"like gladiators honoring one another before the battle.\n"
"Bargaining is expected all over Tamriel, but the game can be broken if one's "
"offer is so preposterously low that it insults the shopkeeper. If you are "
"offered something for ten gold pieces, try offering six and see where that "
"takes you.\n"
"\n"
"Do not look like you are very interested, but do not mock the quality of the "
"goods, even if they deserve it. It is much better to admire the quality of "
"workmanship, but comment that, regretfully, you simply cannot afford such a "
"price. When the shopkeeper compliments your taste, smile, try to resist the "
"flattery.\n"
"\n"
"A lot of the game depends on recognizing the types of shopkeepers. Do not "
"automatically assume that the rural merchant is ignorant and easily fooled "
"or that the rapacious city merchant is selling shoddy merchandise. Caravans, "
"it should be mentioned, are always good places to go to buy or trade.\n"
"\n"
"Knowing what you're buying and who you're buying from is a talent bought "
"only after years of practice. Know the specialties of certain regions and "
"merchants before you even set foot in a shop. Recognize the prejudices of "
"the region. In Morrowind, where I hail from, Argonians are viewed with a "
"certain amount of suspicion. Don't be surprised or insulted if the "
"shopkeepers follow you around the shop, assuming you're going to steal "
"something. Similarly, Nords, Bretons, and Cyrodiils are sometimes treated "
"coolly by merchants in the Summerset Isles. Of course, I don't know any "
"shopkeepers anywhere, no matter their open-mindedness, who aren't alerted "
"when a Khajiit or a Bosmer enters their shop. Even Khajiiti and Bosmeri "
"shopkeepers are wary of their own kind.\n"
"\n"
"If you see something you really like or need, buy it then and there at the "
"best price you can get. I cannot tell you how many times I passed up a rare "
"and interesting relic, assuming that I could find it elsewhere in the "
"region, perhaps at a larger town at a better price. Too late, I discovered I "
"was wrong. When I returned to the shop weeks later, the item I wanted was "
"gone. Better to get a great purchase at a decent price and discover it again "
"at a worse price than to miss out on your opportunities for ownership. "
"Occasionally, impulsiveness is the best buying strategy.\n"
"\n"
"Sense the moves of the game, and everyone can win."

"\n"
"Trained Miner: 15 gold/day, plus 10 gold/day rations\n"
"Argonian Miner: 10 gold/day, plus 8 gold/day rations\n"

"Indentured servants' output varies wildly, but on a long-term basis, they "

"\n"
"Goblins are a wild card. So far, they dig like maniacs and have absolutely "

"    freshly ground black pepper to taste\n"
"    1 cup vinegar\n"

"Directions\n"
"\n"
"Soak the slaughterfish fillet in a brine solution for at least 14 hours. "
"Also, submerge the alder wood plank in water, placing a heavy object on top "
"of it to prevent floating.\n"
"\n"
"Prepare an outdoor smoker on deck, filling the heating receptacle with fire "
"salts. Ignite the fire salts using flint and steel and bring to high heat. \n"
"\n"
"Remove the slaughterfish from the brine, rinse thoroughly under cold running "
"fresh water, and pat dry. Remove the wood plank from the water, and lay the "
"fish out on the plank. Season with freshly ground black pepper.\n"
"\n"
"Smoke the slaughterfish for at least 8 hours, checking after 5 1/2 hours for "
"doneness. The fish is done when it flakes with a fork, but it should also "
"not be too salty. As the fish smokes, the salt content reduces. Adjust the "
"cooking time and salty flavor to your taste. \n"
"\n"
"WARNING: Under no circumstances should fire salts be combined with "

"(An Excerpt)\n"
"\n"
"Any legitimate merchant who's traded in eastern Greenshade knows to avoid "
"the old Merchant Tunnels.\n"
"\n"
"In old times, when we first asked the Green to create a passage, the tunnels "
"were an important byway, a defense against the wilder things that live in "
"the forest.\n"
"\n"
"Now, it's a haven for all that's illicit, illegal, and disgusting. "
"Backhanded traders moving unreliable product at outrageous costs. Black "
"market trade. Skooma. It's all there. A sure way to call one's legitimacy as "
"a merchant into question is to pass through those tunnels.\n"
"\n"
"For this reason, though the way is treacherous, it is advised to avoid the "
"tunnels and take the low route over the bridge, beyond the bone pits.\n"
"\n"
"Other good advice for Valenwood merchants is to travel well-armed, and to "
"keep a watch at night. The Wood Elves of the area are known for their "
"thieving, and some can be extremely unfriendly to strangers.\n"
"\n"
"In general, it's a good idea to stick close to Woodhearth and other major "
"settlements, rather than trying to deal with the backwoods Green Pact Bosmer "
"personally. Let Wood Elves deal with Wood Elves."

"\n"
"Amethysts! Since my youth, their purple translucence has entranced me. I "
"have made a career of searching for them all across Hammerfell, and count "
"many notable, even legendary finds to my credit. But nowhere have I found "
"amethysts so abundant as in the central Alik'r Desert. \n"
"\n"
"Amethysts are found in geodes, those heavy, dull stony orbs that conceal so "
"much crystalline glory, and these geodes are always found in proximity with "
"the lava rock that melted and flowed when the world was young. It has been "
"long and long since the mounts of Hammerfell flowed with lava, and many of "
"the old, old tubes have been covered over by layers of later rock, or "
"weathered away and scattered as sand and gravel. \n"
"\n"
"But in the Hollow Wastes, that sunken, salty pit in the center of the "
"Alik'r, the layers over the ancient lava have been scoured away by the "
"relentless winds, and the flowstone is exposed as nowhere else in Hammerfell."
" Here, at Dak'fron, at Kulati, and at Zareth M'Kai, can be found the finest "
"amethysts in western Tamriel. And many years I spent there, with pick, "
"shovel, and dowsing rod, until they said I could find geode clusters deep in "
"the ground by sense of smell alone. \n"
"\n"
"Nowadays, alas, I am too old to quarter the desert, searching for my beloved "
"amethyst nodules. But if you are even in Rihad, stop in Ezdwelen's Gem Shop "
"and buy an intaglio-engraved amethyst necklace for your best beloved. With "
"such as I sell, even a heart of stone will melt and flow."

"This is important, so pay attention. You already think you know how to build "
"an Alik'r caravel, but the new king over in Sentinel has ordered the "
"shipyards to build all vessels to consistent standards—he thinks that'll "
"make them easier to supply, since all the pieces are standardized, and also "

"don't know—but I do know that he's the king, and we're spending his gold, so "
"we're going to do it his way. \n"
"\n"
"There's no change to how we lay the keel: we still scarf together sections "
"of lumber with the longest piece in the middle, with the ends using planks "
"cut from angled trunks so the curve is built right into the wood. But here's "
"the new thing: the keel, stem, and stern posts are all rabbeted to secure "
"the strakes and keep them parallel. And the posts aren't self-timber, "
"they're made of inner and outer pieces to reinforce the curve. \n"
"\n"
"We still install the central rib first, then the fore and afters, but now "
"we're going to lay battens across the upper, middle, and lower sections to "

"strakes as usual, starting with the futtocks, and finish with the inner hull."
