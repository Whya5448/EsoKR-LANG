"\n"
"Article 1 \n"
"An Embassy shall be prominently established in the Port City of <<2>> to "
"accommodate a Maormer Ambassador and associated retinue. Costs shall be "
"afforded by the people of <<1>>, who agree to supply a personal staff of no "

"\n"
"Article 2\n"
"All individuals and organizations wishing to engage in commerce via the Port "
"City of <<2>> must henceforth be registered and obtain official Rights of "
"Passage. Registration fees are to be determined by the Ambassador on a ship-"
"by-ship basis. Those who refuse such fees will be treated as enemy agents "

"any vessel in the port and surrounding waters for any reason, and to "
"confiscate any goods considered contraband.\n"
"\n"
"Article 3\n"
"Maormer Enforcement Squadrons shall not perpetrate unprovoked acts of "
"aggression towards merchant ships in or around the Port City of <<2>>, and "
"likewise shall not interfere with approved trade affairs. Any current "
"prisoners of the two signatories shall be released immediately upon the "
"signing of this treaty. Said squadrons shall act in self-defense and under "
"reasonable suspicion of activities of enemy agents. As recognition for "
"Maormer non-interference, fifteen percent of all registry fees and excises "
"shall be rendered unto the Embassy on the 15th of every month.\n"
"\n"
"Article 4\n"
"A joint holiday shall be established to commemorate this signing on today's "
"date. Such holiday shall be afforded at the expense of the people of <<2>> "
"to demonstrate peace between the parties and adherence to the treaty. This "
"celebration shall be named \"\"Serpent's Glory,\"\" and on this day, Maormer "
"dignitaries and selected Mer, Men, and others of note shall be invited to "
"the Island of <<1>> for feasting, music, and revelry in the parties' common "
"success and accord.\n"
"\n"
"Article 4, Addendum 1\n"
"Attendance of general festivities during Serpent's Glory is permitted to "
"residents of the Port City of <<2>>, though feast participation shall be "
"limited to Maormer invitees, the Mayor of <<1>>, and no more than three (3) "
"guests selected by the Mayor and approved by the Ambassador. Foodstuffs "

"and under no circumstances shall the repugnant dish \"\"sugared "

"The peoples of the Daggerfall Covenant are a strong and diverse group. It is "
"our differences that help us be strong. We complement each other. This is "
"not true of the other races of Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"The Elves\n"
"\n"
"The High Elves who rule over the \"\"lesser\"\" races in the Aldmeri "
"Dominion are without a doubt the most arrogant of the Elf races, which is "
"saying quite a bit. High Elves believe that they are the direct descendants "
"of the Aedra! They rule over the Wood Elves and Khajiit while giving them "
"token positions within the ruling hierarchy to keep them content. Rumors of "
"harsh punishments for disobedience cannot be confirmed as any dissidents "
"quickly disappear.\n"
"\n"
"The Wood Elves are a barbaric people who are willing to submit to High Elf "
"rule as long as their practices of cannibalism are allowed to continue. They "
"eat their enemies and even one another. They worship the trees of Valenwood, "
"refusing to cut them down or harm the animals that live there. Who does "
"things like that?\n"
"\n"
"The Dark Elves of Morrowind are almost as bad as the High Elves. The "
"Tribunal rulers of the Dark Elves have convinced their people that they are "
"\"\"Living Gods\"\" possessing great powers and immortality. These old "
"wizards openly imitate what was called the \"\"Good Daedra\"\" as part of "
"their Dark Elf ancestral worship.\n"
"\n"
"The Beast Races\n"
"\n"
"The Khajiit are the \"\"cat-people\"\" of Elsweyr. Many rumors exist about "
"the Khajiit, and they are certainly all true. The Khajiit are a society of "
"thieves and addicts. Most spend their time consuming vast quantities of the "
"addictive substance distilled from moon-sugar. Thievery is second nature to "
"these cats, as stealing often supports their addictions.\n"
"\n"
"Argonians are the \"\"lizard folk\"\" of the Black Marsh. Little is known "
"about their culture save for a few rumors and lots of hearsay. It is known "
"that they believe they originate from the trees that grow in Black Marsh. "
"The environment of the marsh has given the Argonians a resistance to the "
"toxic substances found there. The society of Black Marsh is primitive by the "
"standards of the other races.\n"
"\n"
"Humans\n"
"\n"
"The Nords are the hardened folk of the north. Hailing from Skyrim, these "
"brutes live for war and conquest. When not fighting others, the Nords fight "
"among themselves. The Nords are not a very bright people. It seems that the "
"thin air in Skyrim has led to a stunting of the mental capacity of the Nords."
"\n"
"\n"
"The Cyrodiils are a cunning and ruthless people. The central location of "
"Cyrodiil has given them contact with all the races of Tamriel and made them "
"fine traders and diplomats. It has also made them very shrewd with silver "
"tongues and cheating ways. They have a sense of entitlement to rule. Of all "
"the enemies of the Daggerfall Covenant, it is the people of Cyrodiil that "
"are the most dangerous."

"The wedding of Indaenir and Gwaering, the new Silvenar and Green Lady, is an "
"important occasion for the Bosmer, and as such is important to the Aldmeri "
"Dominion.\n"
"\n"
"With the unrest currently rampant throughout Malabal Tor, it is important "
"the Queen's representatives understand how to interact with the Bosmer.\n"
"\n"
"The following information is based upon \"\"Bosmer Traditions and "
"Manners,\"\" by the highly respected Altmer author Cirantille.\n"
"\n"
"According to their legends, the Bosmer were once wild and savage (not at all "
"like they are now) and able to change shape at will. Wishing to become more "
"civilized, they made a bargain with Y'ffre, giving up shapeshifting in "
"exchange for (what they think is) a more civilized demeanor.\n"
"\n"
"This Green Pact affected every aspect of their lives. They became very "
"ritualistic and, while these rituals may seem odd to … differently civilized "
"… peoples, they do keep the Wood Elves from becoming fully savage again.\n"
"\n"
"One of their most important rituals is the Handfasting. It happens once a "
"generation and is responsible for both anointing and marrying two of their "
"three most important leaders (the third being the Camoran King or Queen of "
"the Wood Elves).\n"
"\n"
"No one but the Bosmer know how these two leaders are chosen, but they are, "
"and the Handfast is the ritual that binds the Green Lady and the Silvenar "
"together.\n"
"\n"
"The Silvenar is the spiritual leader of the Bosmer, and a truly civilizing "
"force on the entire race. Some say he is the embodiment of the Green Pact, "
"others that he's simply a powerful mystic.\n"
"\n"
"When a Bosmer becomes the Silvenar, he or she gains a great understanding of "
"the land they inhabit as well as its people.\n"
"\n"
"The Green Lady, on the other hand, is a pure force of nature. She is the "
"physicality of the Bosmer: a hunter, warrior, and nearly-unstoppable fist of "
"her people.\n"
"\n"
"Do not confuse her passion for savagery, however! The Green Lady inherits "
"the tactical poise of all those who've gone before her. The only thing that "
"can turn her into a true beast is the death of her Silvenar … an occurrence "
"some of us had the misfortune to witness on Khenarthi Island. It is a wonder "
"anyone survived.\n"
"\n"
"Take the Handfast as seriously as the Bosmer do and you should be fine. Eat "
"what is offered (don't ask what it is), but drink sparingly—their ritual "
"drink \"\"rotmeth\"\" will sicken the most powerful non-Bosmer stomach if "
"consumed with abandon.\n"
"\n"
"Avoid conflict when you can, but participating in a few non-lethal brawls "
"during the celebration may not be avoidable. Indeed, it may be expected."
