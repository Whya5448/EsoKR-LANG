"At long last, a moment to write! So much has transpired since our journey "
"into the Swallowed Grove, I hardly know where to begin.\n"
"\n"
"Xukas and Jaxsik-Orrn's dream-wallow ritual certainly lived up to the "
"fantastical anecdotes they told me. After inhaling a potent alchemical "
"smoke, our new friend drifted into vivid visions of the past and learned "
"that the Remnant was actually the creation of a lost Argonian tribe. Long "
"ago, a band of Barsaebic Ayleids raided the tribe's village, threatening to "
"wipe out the Argonians who dwelt there, and consume their souls for good "
"measure! Fortunately, the Argonian elders managed to create a vessel to "
"store and protect the souls of their tribe—the Remnant of Argon.\n"
"\n"
"No sooner had we learned this truth, than Kassandra betrayed us! She filched "
"a magic staff that manifested during the ritual, and ran off (with me in "
"tow!)\n"
"\n"
"The next few hours were pure horror. Her spooky henchman, Whiptail, proved "
"even worse than I thought. He even tried to sacrifice me to Sithis! Thank "
"goodness, my new friend intervened just in time, and rescued me from that "
"Blackguard brute.\n"
"\n"
"After a number of unexpected turns, and a lengthy chase, my friend and I "
"caught up with Kassandra. Alas, too late to save her from herself. She "
"touched the Remnant, and found herself bound to a massive Mireguant. She "
"gained control of the creature for a time, but our hero still managed to "
"defeat her. I remain dreadfully conflicted about the whole thing. Kassandra "
"clearly had to be stopped, but I can't help but feel that I failed her in "
"some way. Had I only recognized her madness beforehand, she might still be "
"alive. It's a sad business.\n"
"\n"
"In any event, once Kassandra fell, I took up the Remnant and urged Xukas, "
"Jaxsik-Orrn, and our hero to reach inside it. Truthfully, I barely remember "
"it. Something in the Hist took hold of me. It was not painful, but nor was "
"it comfortable. A person like me isn't meant to hold something like that for "
"long!\n"
"\n"
"I wasn't privy to all that happened inside the Remnant, and I'm still "
"reeling from the loss of a friend. But it buoys my spirits to know that "
"their sacrifice was not in vain. The Root-Whisper Hist just burst into full "
"bloom, and a new tribe gathered beneath its branches. A new beginning—even "
"for me. Without Kassandra's support and leadership, Cyrodilic Collections "
"will not be what it was. But after all I've seen and been through, I'm more "
"confident than ever that we can make it something even greater than before. "
"I can't wait for our next adventure!"

"드디어 집필할 시간이 도래했다! 압도할만한 숲에 당도하고 나서 수많은 일들이 있었다. 어디서부터 시작하면 좋을지 모르겠다.\n"
"\n"
"Xukas와 Jaxsik-Orrn의 꿈에 빠져드는 의식은 그들이 말한 환상적인 전설에 비할만했다. 강력한 연금술의 연기를 들이마신뒤, "
"새로운 친구는 과거의 선명한 환상에 빠져들어 그것이 실로 그 자취가 잊혀진 아르고니안 부족이 만든 것임을 알게 되었다. 옛날 "
"Barsaebic Ayleid의 일원이 그 부족의 마을을 습격하고 그곳에 살고있던 아르고니안을 모조리 살해하였고, 더군다나 그 영혼을 "
"사용하려하기까지 했다! 운 좋게도 아르고니안의 장로는 부족의 영혼을 보관하고 지키는 그릇을 만들었다. 그것이 아르곤의 자취이다.\n"
"\n"
"우리들이 그것을 알고나서 Kassandra는 우리들을 배신했다! 그녀는 의식 중에 나타난 마법 지팡이를 빼앗고 도망쳤다 (나를 질질 "
"끌면서 말이지!)\n"
"\n"
"그 후 수 시간 동안은 정말 두려웠다. 그녀의 불쾌한 부하 Whiptail은 생각했던것보다 그 이상으로 지독한 녀석이었다. 나를 시시스에 "
"바치려했기 때문이다! 나의 새로운 벗이 들이마실때 나타나 저 블랙가드의 악당으로부터 나를 구해주었다.\n"
"\n"
"몇 가지 예상치못한 전개와 길고긴 추적 후, 친구와 나는 Kassandra를 따라잡았다. 하지만 아쉽게도 그녀를 구하기에는 너무 늦었다. "
"Kassandra는 자취를 따라 거대한 Mireguant와 결합해버린 것이다. 그녀는 일시적으로 괴물을 지배했지만 우리들의 영웅은 격파에 "
"성공했다. 나는 이 사건으로 아직 고민하고 있다. Kassandra를 막는 것은 분명히 필요했다. 하지만 무슨 방법을 썼더라도 그녀를 "
"구할수는 없었을것이다. 그녀의 광기를 조금만 더 빨리 눈치챘다면 Kassandra는 지금도 살아있을지도 모른다. 애석하다.\n"
"\n"
"어쨌든 Kassandra가 쓰러진 뒤, 나는 자취를 간직한채로 Xukas와 Jaxsik-Orrn 그리고 우리들의 영웅에게 부탁해 안으로 "
"들었다.  나는 대부분의 것들을 기억하지 못한다. 히스트 속에서 무언가가 나를 끌어안았다. 고통스럽지는 않았지만 기분좋지도 않았다. 내가 "
"저런걸 오랫동안 간직해서는 안되었다!\n"
"\n"
"자취 속에서 생긴 일은 그다지 명쾌하지는 않지만, 친구를 한명 잃었다는 사실에 나는 아직도 동요하고 있다. 하지만, 희생이 헛된 것이 "
"아니었음을 알게되어 약간 기분은 풀렸다. Root-Whisper 히스트는 완전히 꽃이 피고 나뭇가지 아래에 새로운 부족이 모였다. 새로운 "
"시작이다. 나에겐 있어서 말이지. Kassandra의 지지와 리더쉽이 없어진 지금 시로딜 콜렉션은 예전 그대로 있지 않을것이다. 하지만 "
"여러가지 일들을 보고 경험한 뒤에는 지금보다 더욱 멋진 일들을 만들어낼수 있는 자신이 있다. 다음 모험이 너무나 기다려진다!"

"And then there are their stone nests that take many hands and many stones to "
"build. But if the ground begins to sink? If storms begin to ravage? Then "
"they are left destitute and miserable. I shake my head at such foolishness. "
"It is another way in which the dryskins wish to be unchanging.\n"

"A last truth to be written. These outsiders must never be tolerated. They "
"have shown their vile natures time and time again. May the tribes of Black "

"Blackrose Prison, named after the infamous city of Blackrose, is said to "
"have been built in a single day. Whether such an account is mere "
"exaggeration or a spectacular truth, no one is certain. What is certain, "
"however, is that Potentate Versidue-Shaie ordered the prison's construction, "
"and Pelladil Direnni dutifully—or boastfully—fulfilled the order by "
"summoning an army of stone atronachs to perform the labor. \n"
"\n"
"Though often thought to be built adjacent to the city, the prison's location "
"is actually a day's march south, within the dangers of the swamp but "
"accessible from the coast. This isolated location was specifically chosen to "
"deter prisoners from escaping its confines. Few non-natives have been known "
"to successfully traverse the dangers of Murkmire, especially those as ill-"
"equipped as escaped prisoners would be.\n"
"\n"
"Imperial prisoners were sent to Blackrose Prison only for the most heinous "
"or politically charged crimes. This was where men and mer alike were sent "
"when the reigning power wished to never see them again. As such, the "
"accountability of the prison staff was near non-existent. The brutality and "
"cruelty that these prisoners faced was, by all accounts, particularly horrid."
"\n"
"\n"
"Given its convenient location, all Murkmire natives who conflicted with "
"Imperial power would wind up within Blackrose Prison as well. Nagas in "
"particular were apt to find their way here, given their rebellious nature "
"against Imperial oppression. Even among their fellow prisoners, Nagas were "
"treated with particular disdain, most likely provoked by their aggressive "
"culture and drastic appearance. It is theorized that an increase in the Naga "
"prisoner population, as well as a decline in Imperial power in the region, "
"led to the mass riots that eventually forced Blackrose Prison to be "
"abandoned.\n"
"\n"
"In the years following its abandonment, the prison was taken over by the "
"very prisoners who were rumored to liberate it. Reclaiming that which once "
"imprisoned them, they swore to eradicate any Imperials who dared to threaten "
"their homeland. They called themselves the Blackguards, and swore loyalty to "
"none but themselves.\n"
"\n"
"This claim was not well received by the surrounding tribes, who believed "
"that such values went against the very cornerstones of their culture. One "
"Argonian I spoke to had this to say on the matter: \"\"The Blackguards, they "
"have stone hearts and sour bellies, hiding from change within their stone "
"nest. Always they look back, never forward. It is because of this that the "
"tribes would not support them. And now they are little more than bandits."
"\"\"\n"

"Indeed, no matter how heroic their original ideals might have been, the "
"Blackguards are now known as the largest crime organization within Murkmire. "

"adamantly fought against.\n"

"[Note: Collected by researcher Solis Aduro from an oral tradition of the "
"Adzi-Kostleel tribe and not otherwise attested.]\n"
"\n"
"There was first only Atak, the Great Root. It knew of nothing but itself, so "
"it decided to be everything. It grew and grew, trying to fill the nothing "
"with itself. As it grew it formed new roots, and those roots took names, and "
"they wanted space of their own to grow. \n"
"\n"
"Then Atak learned that there were things other than itself.  They were just "
"like Atak, but went a different way from it. They saw and made strange new "
"things that did not last except in how it changed them.\n"
"\n"
"Atak continued to grow until something came back from the nothing. It was "
"like a root but had scales and eyes and a mouth. It told Atak that it was "
"called Kota, and it had been growing, too. Now that it had a mouth, it was "
"hungry.\n"
"\n"
"Atak named Kota for what it was: serpent! It put roots through the serpent's "
"eyes. But Kota was old and strong like the root, and had grown fangs while "
"it was away. It bit Atak. They coiled around each other. From their "
"struggle, new things came to be. Atak learned things Kota had learned, "
"including hunger, and so it bit Kota back. They ate and roiled for so long "
"they became one and forgot their conflict. \n"
"\n"
"They shed their skin and severed their roots and called themselves Atakota, "
"who said \"\"Maybe.\"\" \n"
"\n"
"When Atakota said this, the skin it had shed knew itself. It ate the severed "
"roots and even though it was dead, it followed Atakota like a shadow. \n"
"\n"
"Atakota continued to roil, and each of its scales was a world that it "
"devoured. But now Atakota was not in conflict, and things had time to begin "
"and end. The shadow wished it could eat these things, but its belly was full "
"of roots that were growing.\n"
"\n"
"When the shadow could bear it no longer, it swam closer to Atakota and spat "
"out the roots. Now that its belly was empty, the shadow almost ate them "
"again and everything else it saw. But it had come to see the roots as its "
"own after carrying them, so instead it told them secrets and went to sleep.\n"
"\n"
"The roots found others and told them how they had survived in the belly of "
"the shadow and how they were still able to grow there. When they shared this "
"knowledge with the others it changed them, and they took on new forms with "
"new names. \n"
"\n"
"Some of these spirits wanted to keep the names and forms they had chosen, "
"but they had learned them through the shadow, and it was now in all of them, "
"making them temporary. They learned of hunger and conflict, and they learned "
"to fear change and called it Death.\n"
"\n"
"These spirits were angry and afraid, but the roots showed the spirits ways "
"between places from when Atak had made paths out of nothing. They could use "
"these riverways to hide from Death.\n"
"\n"
"The spirits were content and set about to make things that looked like them "
"and shared in their aspects and loved them. They kept growing until they "
"were as big as Atakota, and they forgot it came before them, and that it had "
"a shadow that was sleeping.\n"
"\n"
"In time, the worlds were too big and there was no more room. Again the "
"spirits went to the roots to ask for more. But the roots had gone to sleep "
"content with what they had made, because it changed so often that it did not "
"need to grow. \n"
"\n"
"The spirits grew so desperate and hungry that they tore at Atakota's skin "
"and drank of its blood. They ate until they broke Atakota, so that Atak "
"remembered growing, and Kota remembered being nothing. There was conflict "
"again, and from the spirits Atak and Kota learned about Death, so there was "
"violence, blood, and sap.\n"
"\n"
"In the chaos the spirits were lost and afraid, so they ate others and "
"themselves. They drank of blood and sap, and they grew scales and fangs and "
"wings. And these spirits forgot why they had made anything other than to eat "
"it.\n"
"\n"
"There were other spirits that still clung to what they were and what they "
"had made. A forest spirit came and saw that the roots loved their children "
"like she loved hers, so she taught them to walk and talk. They told her "
"secrets with new words, and she sang the song back to them. The roots woke "
"up when they heard this, and joined with the forest. \n"
"\n"
"The roots saw that Kota's blood had made oceans, and Atak's sap had made "
"stones, and each of these spirits had never known the shadow. The roots knew "
"what this would mean, and asked the shadow to protect its children.\n"
"\n"
"The shadow woke. It looked upon Kota and Atak and saw how different the "
"nothing had become and how it was becoming the same as before. It remembered "
"it was the skin of Atakota, and it was bigger than Kota or Atak alone, so it "
"decided it would eat them both. \n"
"\n"
"And it did. The shadow ate the snake and the root, and the sap and stone, "
"and the oceans of blood, and all of the spirits. It had eaten everything "
"before it remembered the roots that were its children, so it looked unto "
"itself to find them. When the shadow saw this, it remembered that it was a "
"skin of something that came before, and it had eaten what came after, and "
"this would be an end that always was.\n"
"\n"
"And so the shadow shed its skin, even though that was all it was, and it "
"fell like a shroud over the roots, promising to keep them safe within its "
"secrets."

"\n"
"그런 대혼란 속에서 영혼은 어찌할 바를 몰라 두려워하여 다른 사람이나 서로를 먹게 되었다. 피와 수액을 마시고 비늘과 송곳니, 날개를 "

"Brother Septimius,\n"
"\n"
"Since you took me as your pupil, I have learned many things. The most "
"important lesson, for me, was finally having someone tell me to be reckless. "
"Like you, I have a curious soul. I could not have lived a normal life. You "
"told me to let my curiosity get me killed if I had to. You gave me a list of "
"mysteries to solve and sent me into Black Marsh. You taught me not to fear "
"Argonia. You kept me afloat, and I had not realized it until I received word "
"of your failing health.\n"
"\n"
"We have shared many discoveries through our correspondence over the years. I "
"truly believe I will complete the list one day. Assuming, that is, I can "
"ever return to Black Marsh. Yes, Brother Septimius, even though you bade me "
"not to worry, I have set out for Cyrodiil. I will be at your side through "
"this. Until then, I will put personal matters aside and give you something "
"to read while you are abed. \n"
"\n"
"You placed the most difficult mystery at the top of the list, no doubt "
"hoping it would scare me off. What is the nature of the Hist?\n"
"\n"
"I do not have the answer. I do not even have many statements to make about "
"this subject I would consider fact. I only hope you will still enjoy my "
"conjecture.\n"
"\n"
"They are merely trees say some skeptical people. Trees grown by the lizard "
"folk of Black Marsh so they can drink of the sap. They all remember Topal's "
"description of a fetid and evil place, and they naturally draw wary "
"conclusions. Legions came back speaking of venomous plants, poisonous bogs, "
"and strange defenders that attack with fury one day and ignore invaders the "
"next. And when even the more \"\"civilized\"\" lizard folk cannot seem to "
"provide answers that assuage their fears, well, it is no surprise these so-"
"called learned scholars have come to fear Argonians and their strange trees.\n"
"\n"
"Those in our circle would add that these trees are sentient, and it may be "
"that they are the ones that grew the lizard folk. I had hoped to prove or "
"disprove this by careful study of the birth cycle of the Saxhleel. "
"Unfortunately, as you know, every answer was another question. I can only "
"say with certainty that every interview I have been able to conduct about "
"this topic resulted in the conclusion that the Saxhleel cannot fathom the "
"idea of one coming before the other. I will not digress into further "
"discussion about the way this fascinating culture views linear events, as "
"you have asked me not to do so every time I write. \n"
"\n"
"But I can tell you this, old friend, the Hist are not simply trees, "
"regardless of sentience. It is true that the trees are impressive and demand "
"a certain respect when you stand beneath them, but I have always found the "
"roots most fascinating. If only I could properly describe the things I have "
"seen, Brother Septimius. Beneath the swamp the roots grow deep and spread so "
"wide it is impossible to know which tree they originated from. In a way, I "
"believe, the roots are the marsh. The roots hold it all together, and they "
"determine when it changes.\n"
"\n"
"I know we have spoken of this before, and you posited that the chaotic "
"nature of the marsh is simply a result of a type of magic similar to what we "
"have seen from the Elves of Valenwood. I cannot refute the claim and I see "
"the logic in it, but I do not believe it to be true. \n"
"\n"
"I have seen skilled trackers foiled by this land on a whim. I cannot say I "
"have ever seen it move, but I have picked up a good enough sense of "
"navigation in my time to know when I am being led in circles. And that is "
"without going into more questionable theories of relative space. I believe "
"like the Saxhleel change to accommodate their environment, the roots change "
"Black Marsh in a way that it sees most fit. \n"
"\n"
"I tell you, Brother Septimius, the province of Black Marsh has never once "
"been close to conquered. The borders can barely even be considered Argonia. "
"The maps cannot be correct. The roots grow too deep and too wide for us to "
"know the true Argonia.\n"
"\n"
"All of academia has been too focused on the sap. Is it not the Wood Elves I "
"just wrote of who call themselves the Tree-Sap People?\n"
"\n"
"The Saxhleel are the People of the Root, and that is where I will find the "
"answer to your most challenging mystery.\n"
"\n"
"It will have to wait until I return. I will see you soon and we will get you "
"on the path to healing. \n"

"\n"
"저는 숙련된 추적자들이 이 땅의 변덕에 좌절하는 모습을 봤습니다. 움직임을 보았다고는 할 수 없지만, 전 경험을 쌓으면서 방향 감각은 "
"충분히 습득했습니다. 더 의심스러운 관련 공간에 대한 이론에 대해서는 말할 것도 없습니다. 저는 색스릴이 환경에 따라 변화하도록, 뿌리도 "

"The ancient Argonian strode toward Matius then, screeching in some guttural "
"tongue. It was two heads taller than an average Saxhleel, with golden "
"scales, bright feathers of red and purple and green, and great curving horns."
" Over its head was a mask of gold carved in the visage of a bird. It wore "
"feathered robes and golden bangles, and when it spread its arms it appeared "
"to have wings. Matius could hardly tell where the creature ended and its "
"ornamentation began.\n"
"\n"
"He had no time to ponder it, as the golden terror raked at him with painted "
"talons. It roared a curse, though Matius could only translate three of its "
"words: Sun, Fire, Death.\n"
"\n"
"Matius staggered back, unable to draw his sword as the creature bore down on "
"him. It was clawing desperately at the yellow gemstone around his neck. "
"Matius fell backward and managed to pull out his sword just as the bird-"
"lizard fell atop him, screeching. He stabbed blindly at it with one hand "
"while pressing against the creature's throat with the other, trying "
"desperately to keep its claws from shredding him. Again and again it "
"scratched at the amulet, trying to tear it from his neck.\n"
"\n"
"Matius heard the gemstone break. Yellow dust floated through the air.\n"
"\n"
"The Argonian was very still then. Matius breathed a sigh of relief that he "
"had killed it at last. His arm was tired. \n"
"\n"
"Suddenly, it moved again with blinding speed. Clawed hands shot out and "
"cupped his face. He half expected to hear the snapping of his own neck, but "
"it just held him in a vice grip. The golden mask slipped from one side of "
"the creature's face. \n"
"\n"
"Now it was not a bird or a lizard, but a snake. He saw that its scales were "
"not gold but painted, and the mask had worn away some of the paint. The "
"scales were black and white and mottled, falling away from a dead thing. Its "
"eyes were hollow sockets, but the dust flowed into them until they were "
"yellow. \n"
"\n"
"Out of fear or courage, Matius struck once more, plunging his sword into the "
"snake. At the same time, the golden mask slipped off and clanged to the "
"floor. There was blood on the inside. Matius saw the snake's face was "
"changing over and over again. Twelve times it changed before it was a snake "
"again.\n"
"\n"
"He had forgotten about killing this creature, forgotten about fighting for "
"his own life, even forgotten why he had come to Black Marsh in the first "
"place. All Matius knew then was terror.\n"
"\n"
"He was falling, then flying. The world rushed up to meet him, all fire and "
"glory and madness. He felt a current on wings he did not remember having and "
"he soared. He flew over cities of gold and cities of black stone. They were "
"endless, like the Hist that cradled them. The sky was aflame and the sun was "
"a pit. Still he flew, for he had not the strength to do more than let the "
"current carry him. \n"
"\n"
"He came upon a tower. It was tall and vast and many trees grew from its many "
"layers of marsh. Creatures lived and died without ever knowing of a world "
"outside the tower. At its top was a tree that bled fire. Other winged things "
"that looked like him circled it. They cried out in words he understood but "
"didn't know. He felt a deep sadness as the tower fell away.\n"
"\n"
"He looked up and saw other worlds and other towers. They were spinning "
"wheels and they crashed into each other, and their spokes got tangled up and "
"they broke each other. And he saw that his world was breaking, too, but "
"quick as a snake a shadow came and swallowed up the roots of the tower so "
"they would not break.\n"
"\n"
"Still he flew. There was only fire and darkness then, and so much noise, but "
"he was too tired to be afraid. And so Matius slept, and drifted away into a "
"black sun."

"이제 그것은 새도 도마뱀도 아닌 뱀이었다. 마티우스는 그 비늘이 황금빛이 아니라 색칠한 것 뿐이라는 걸 알았고, 그 색칠도 벗겨져 있는 "

"공포 때문인지 용기인지, 마티우스는 뱀에게 칼을 찔러 다시 한번 공격했다. 동시에 황금 가면이 미끄러져 떨어져 바닥에 부딪쳐 달랑거렸다. "

"There was the sound again. Matius waved his torch fruitlessly. He could see "
"nothing in the choking mist. He held his cloak to his mouth with his free "
"hand and ran deeper into the cave.\n"
"\n"
"Gloop Gloop.\n"
"\n"
"He caught sight of the creature's shadow, massive and bulbous. It was "
"following him. He ran on and on, gasping for breath. \n"
"\n"
"Gloop Gloop.\n"
"\n"
"He heard an echo of belching laughter. It went on until Matius thought he "
"must be going mad. Then he heard the crunch of bones under his feet. The "
"mist cleared and he found himself standing in a chamber lined with skulls of "
"all shapes and sizes. Bones of things he didn't recognize littered the floor."
" He thought of the vile voriplasm, said to eat creatures whole and spit out "
"their bones. \"\"That will be my end,\"\" he breathed. He should have known "
"the Argonian was lying.\n"
"\n"

"Matius felt the air in the chamber change. There came a stench so foul that "
"it burned his nostrils. \n"
"\n"
"A voice bellowed. \"\"Another fleshling come to deal with N'buta? Speak in "
"whole before I swallow.\"\" \n"
"\n"
"In the dim torchlight Matius could just barely make out the grotesque "
"creature's form. This was no plasm, though it glistened with a disgusting "
"wetness. It was some kind of giant toad with a rotund belly and a squished, "
"slug-like face. The eyes were the worst of all, and in them Matius saw "
"forbidden knowledge and boundless horrors. He steeled himself as the "
"creature's throat bulged. Forbidden knowledge was why he came to this "
"decrepit place, after all. The creature swallowed, and suddenly it was "
"looming over him. Nauseating fumes trailed from its nostrils.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I seek the path to the golden stair,\"\" Matius spat out. He was not "
"proud of how his voice cracked.\n"
"\n"
"The creature reared back and either choked or laughed. It belched after, "
"Matius knew, for he nearly fainted. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"I can show you,\"\" the slug-thing croaked. \"\"For a price.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Of course, good Lord of Muck,\"\" Matius said, wishing he hadn't. He "
"knew better than to think he could appease this thing with flattery. Best to "
"just stick to business. \"\"What will this information cost me?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Fat arms reached into a pocket. Matius had not even noticed the creature was "
"wearing tattered robes of green and brown. Nubby wet fingers produced a "
"sparkling yellow gem set into an ornate golden amulet. It was flawless and "
"gleaming, but Matius was no novice to cursed relics or strange gems. He drew "
"his sword and waited. His heart raced, though whether with fear or "
"excitement he couldn't tell. Was this a relic of old Argonia? The creature's "
"chin wiggled grossly as it laughed.  \n"
"\n"
"It draped the amulet across the horned skull of some ancient beast, leaving "
"it dangling there, glinting in the torchlight. \"\"You will take this to the "
"golden city for N'buta. That is the price.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Matius furrowed his brow. \"\"And what am I to do with it once I get "
"there?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You will know,\"\" N'buta whispered. Matius's skin crawled at the way "
"the words tickled the inside of his ear. \"\"Just before you die.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"For a moment Matius thought the creature was right beside him, but he "
"blinked and saw it had not moved. \"\"Tell me the way,\"\" he managed to say."
"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You cannot get there from here,\"\" said the Lord of Muck. \"\"You must "
"go as deep as the roots-in-water, down and around and between places even "
"your gods have never seen.\"\" Matius found himself unable to speak as the "
"creature burped and finished. \"\"I will take you as far as Xul-Axith.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Matius breathed despite the stench and sheathed his blade. He stepped "
"forward and picked up the golden amulet. It felt warm. \"\"I don't plan on "
"dying,\"\" he said, slipping the amulet into his pack. \"\"I hope that won't "
"disappoint you.\"\"\n"

"The creature's belching laughter echoed until Matius found himself standing "
"alone, the light of his torch nearly burnt out."

"For three days they traveled by water, and at night River-Gills would show "
"them where it was safe to stop and rest.\n"
"\n"
"On the first day, River-Gills made them stop under a rocky outcropping on "
"the river bank for several hours without ever saying why. Matius passed the "
"time teaching Riffen about many of the strange plants and animals that "
"occupied the swamp. He was far more interested in those he could not name, "
"but he would not let himself be distracted by thoughts of trapping them for "
"study. There were many-colored birds, giant beetles with shells the size of "
"boulders, and scaled hounds that roamed in packs and fed on the carcasses of "
"gray behemoths. Matius could think of no names for any of them. \n"
"\n"
"By the time they resumed the journey, night was falling. River-Gills assured "
"them this was the time to travel despite protests from the rest of the group."
" Matius made the call to trust their Argonian guide, and so down the river "
"they continued. Even Salara joined them in gazing into the swamp, as it was "
"now alight with strange luminescent jellies that passed mournfully through "
"the trees.\n"
"\n"
"On the second day, Riffen spotted something and called out, \"\"Look!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Salara gasped. Matius turned to look and was stricken as speechless as the "
"others. Rising from the mire were great wings of metal, like the wings of a "
"moth. Even through the moss and muck, Matius could make out the twin domes "
"of layered glass eyes. He wondered how magnificent such a thing must have "
"looked whole, whatever it was.\n"
"\n"
"River-Gills did not turn his gaze from the winding river before them. The "
"fins on his head vibrated so quickly they made a low hum.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"We have to stop. I must see this.\"\" Salara's voice carried a tremor. "
"She held a hand out to River-Gills.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"We cannot stop,\"\" River-Gills said patiently. \"\"A leviathan has been "
"trailing us for some time now.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Salara paused for only a moment, and then jumped from the raft, causing the "
"rest of them to struggle to keep their footing. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"Salara!\"\" Matius yelled out as he tried to shift his weight and "
"balance the raft. \"\"River-Gills, slow us down.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"We cannot stop,\"\" said River-Gills.\n"
"\n"
"Salara moved as quickly as she could through the muck, ignoring the protests "
"of the crew. She unfastened her cloak and let it fly free so she could move "
"more easily. She flailed and splashed as she made for the strange moth.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Lady Salara! Come back!\"\" Riffen yelled.\n"
"\n"
"She trudged slowly now, struggling in the mire. She stopped and began to "
"whisper words of power Matius assumed would aid her movement. He saw she had "
"the broken compass in her hand.\n"
"\n"
"Suddenly, it was as if the swamp itself dragged her down and swallowed her "
"up. She disappeared without making a sound and never resurfaced. Matius "
"could just barely make out the shape of something huge moving through the "
"water. He noticed that even the insects had gone quiet.\n"
"\n"
"Salara's cloak drifted listlessly, the clasp of her order the only thing "
"remaining of her story.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"We cannot stop,\"\" said River-Gills.\n"
"\n"
"No one argued. In fact, they did not speak again that day. At night, they "
"slept in a tree the size of a village.\n"
"\n"
"The next morning, Matius woke to find Riffen was gone. He had left a note "
"saying he had seen the torchlight of a nearby settlement from and was going "
"to see if they could help him get back to civilization. He apologized for "
"abandoning them. Matius knew the young man was already dead. River-Gills "
"made no comment when Matius said they were now simply two.\n"
"\n"
"That day they finally returned to hiking, and though it was difficult "
"terrain Matius found he preferred it. Still, his thoughts were troubled by "
"memories of his previous expedition as they traveled. River-Gills would not "
"take him much further, and Matius had no idea what to expect from the next "
"guide. He remembered what it was like to be afraid and alone in Black Marsh.\n"
"\n"
"On the third night River-Gills expanded his fins and began to hiss, and then "
"bade Matius to take shelter in a cave.\n"
"\n"
"River-Gills remained outside, and for the remainder of the night Matius "
"could not sleep. All through the night he swore he could hear chanting and "
"the hissing of snakes. The Argonian reappeared in the morning as if nothing "
"had happened.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"N'buta will see you now,\"\" River-Gills said, and when he left he never "
"returned."

"\n"
"살라라는 이제 늪에 걸려 느릿느릿 나아가고 있었다. 그녀는 멈춰 서서 힘의 말을 속삭였고, 마티우스가 이동을 도울 것이라고 생각했다. "

"\n"
"그러자 갑자기 늪 자체가 그녀를 끌고 들어가 삼켜버린 것 같았다. 그녀는 소리 없이 사라져 두 번 다시 떠오르지 않았다. 마티우스는 단지 "

"임무의 중요성을 일깨움으로써 그들의 사기를 북돋울 수 있으면 좋겠다고 생각했다. 그리고 모닥불을 둘러싸고 하는 이야기는 언제나 좀 과장된 "

"마티우스로서는 그 청년의 끊임없는 호기심을 인정해야 했다. 마티우스는 일부러 답을 보류했고, 리버 길스가 대답해 주기를 반쯤 기대했다. "

"알아낸 적이 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"리버 길스는 전혀 듣지 못한 듯 그저 앉아서 햇빛을 쬐었다. 마티우스가 보기에 그 아르고니안은 잠든 것 같았다.\n"

"신이 됐다고 말하는 사람도 있지.\"\"라고 말했다.\n"
"\n"
"엘프 살라나는 실소를 터뜨렸다. \"\"바보같아. 태양이 알이 아니란 건 누구나 알고 있는데.\"\" 마티우스는 그녀가 자신의 신념에 "
"전적으로 일치하는 것 외에는 전투에 대해 거의 배우지 못했고, 그 대부분은 길드의 가르침에서 비롯되었다고 인정했다.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"그럼 뭔데?\"\" 리펜이 물었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"구멍이야.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"리펜은 코를 후비며 올려다보았다. \"\"저게 구멍이라고?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"보면 안돼.\"\" 마티우스는 한숨을 쉬었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"황금의 도시를 믿지 않는 거야, 살라라 누나?\"\"라고 리펜은 물었다. \"\"어떤 선원이 그냥 이야기라고 하던데.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"자신의 눈으로 확인하고 싶은 거지.\"\"라고 마티우스가 말했다. 살랄라는 이 탐험에 참여하는 개인적인 이유를 알려주지 않았기 "
"때문에 짐작일 뿐이다.\n"
"\n"
"살라라는 두 사람을 외면하고 수풀을 응시했다. 망가진 나침반을 꺼내서, 그것을 강하게 잡았다.\n"

"\"\"Only three,\"\" Matius protested. Three was barely a scouting party, "
"much less a suitable expedition force. \"\"I was promised nine at minimum."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Tana put her feet up on her desk loudly. \"\"Best I could do, Matius. Your "
"name doesn't hold the weight it used to.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Matius knew it was true, but this was the first time one of his own friends "
"had said as much. He noticed how cold Tana had become toward him since he "
"told her he intended to continue his mission. Ten years gone he had been at "
"the head of an Imperial-sanctioned excursion to properly chart the province "
"of Black Marsh. The borders had been defined well enough, but information "
"about the heart of the swamp was scarce and unverifiable. Even the "
"established description disseminated by the Empire to citizens was a "
"stitched together narrative from numerous questionable accounts.\n"
"\n"
"The venture was considered a failure. His crew had dwindled one by one as "
"the expedition stretched on, either through death or desertion. Tana had "
"been the only one to stay with him, but she contracted a disease that made "
"her delirious and unable to remember the last days of their journey.\n"
"\n"
"And so, when Matius had returned to the college speaking of lost cities and "
"ancient civilizations, he found himself against a wall of skepticism with no "
"other witness to verify his claims. His relationship with Tana was never the "
"same after that. The marsh had changed both of them, and the aftermath had "
"not been easy either. He had hoped they could mend old wounds and return "
"together, but Tana had flatly refused him saying she would never return to "
"Black Marsh. She did offer to help him put together a crew, and Matius knew "
"he should be grateful that anyone would help him at all.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"At least tell me they're seasoned.\"\" He had to hope for that, if "
"little else.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You're in luck,\"\" Tana said, glancing over some papers. \"\"Well, "
"assuming you can get along with a High Elf. She's a battlemage, so I'm sure "
"you'll find a way. Salara is her name. Never heard of her.\"\" \n"
"\n"
"Matius raised a brow. He would be pleased to have such a skilled companion, "
"but something told him to be wary. \"\"Why would a battlemage join me?\"\" \n"
"\n"
"Tana shrugged. \"\"It isn't a sanctioned mission as far as I can tell. My "
"contacts don't know anything about her either. Maybe she wants to go for her "
"own reasons. We can't exactly be particular in this case.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Matius nodded. He would have to keep an eye on this Elf. \"\"And the "
"others?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Riffen, a runaway slave. He's a young Nord, but eager. You know how "
"important that will be. Before you argue, he can read and write, and has "
"some skill in hunting and foraging. He survived on his own this long, after "
"all. Give him a chance.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"An extra pair of hands was never bad, and the crew would be small enough "
"that the young man couldn't get in the way. Still, Matius felt bad knowing "
"how hard the journey would be on someone unprepared for it. \"\"And the "
"third? You still haven't mentioned a guide. We won't get anywhere without a "
"willing Argonian. You remember that much at least.\"\" Matius regretted "
"saying that, but Tana ignored it.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"River-Gills,\"\" she said. \"\"An experienced Argonian guide, just like "
"you asked for. And with only one catch.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"There's a catch?\"\" Matius sighed. \"\"You offered him the sum I "
"promised?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I did. Try to let me finish.\"\" Tana paused, seemingly just to make him "
"wait. \"\"River-Gills will take you part way, at which point he promises to "
"introduce you to someone who can get you where you want to go in half the "
"time.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"A sensible person would walk away from this, Matius thought, but he knew he "
"couldn't. He had waited a decade for another chance, slim as it might be. "
"Matius had heard there were more secretive tribes in the swamp that knew "
"hidden paths, and the idea of making safe contact with them was enticing "
"enough to embolden him.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Very well,\"\" Matius said. \"\"Thank you, Tana.\"\" He turned to leave, "
"but stopped short of the door. \"\"Is there truly nothing I can say to make "
"you come with me? It should be the both of us.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I told you. I wouldn't return to Black Marsh for all the gold in all the "
"known worlds, Matius. And I wish there was something I could say to make you "
"stay.\"\""

"\"\"3명 뿐이라고?\"\" 마티우스는 항의했다. 3명으로는 정찰대도 안 된다. 당연히 본격적인 탐험대와는 거리가 멀었다. "
"\"\"최소한 9명은 약속받았는데.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"타나는 책상 위에 쿵 하고 발을 올렸다. \"\"그게 최선이었어, 마티우스. 네 이름에 이젠 예전 같은 효력이 없단 말야.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"마티우스는 그게 사실이라는 것을 알고는 있었지만 자신의 친구에게서 그런 말을 들은 것은 처음이었다. 자신의 임무를 계속할 것이라고 말하자 "
"타나가 그에게 냉랭해진 것을 마티우스는 깨달았다. 그가 임페리얼 공인 조사단의 지도자로 블랙 마쉬 지역의 정확한 지도를 만들라는 임무를 "
"수행한 지 벌써 10년이 지났다. 국경 지역은 충분히 조사했지만, 늪지의 중심부에 대한 정보는 부족해서 검증 불가능했다. 제국에서 "
"시민에게 배포한 공식 서술조차 무수한 소문에 근거해 만든 짜집기 투성이였다.\n"
"\n"
"탐험은 실패라고 여겨졌다. 그의 선원들은 탐험이 길어짐에 따라 죽거나 임무를 포기하고, 규모를 시시각각으로 줄여나갔다. 타나는 그와 함께 "
"하는 유일한 사람이었지만, 정신이 혼미해져 여행의 마지막 날들을 기억하지 못하는 병에 걸렸다.\n"
"\n"
"마티우스가 대학으로 돌아가서 잃어버린 도시나 고대 문명에 대해 얘기해도 그의 주장을 보증할 목격자가 달리 없어서 회의의 벽에 부딪쳤다. "
"이후, 타나와의 관계는 바뀌어 버렸다. 습지는 이들을 둘 다 바꿔버렸지만 그 여파 또한 만만치 않았다. 마티우스는 옛날 일을 잊고 다시 "
"할 수 있기를 기대했지만, 타나는 다시는 블랙 마쉬로 돌아가지 않겠다며 단호히 거절했다. 그녀는 승무원을 모으는 것을 도와주겠다고 "
"제안했고, 마티우스로서는, 힘을 빌려주는 사람이 있는 것만으로도 감사해야 했다.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"적어도 경험은 풍부한 이들이겠지.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"운이 좋네\"\"라고 타나는 말하며 서류를 바라보았다. \"\"음, 하이 엘프와 사이좋게 지낼 수 있다면 말이지. 그녀는 "
"마검사니까 어떻게든 될 거야. 이름은 살라라. 들은 적 없는 이름이지만.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"마티우스는 눈살을 찌푸렸다. 그런 숙련된 동료들을 얻을 수 있다는 것은 기쁘지만, 뭔가 경계심을 느꼈다. \"\"왜 마검사가 나랑 "
"동행하는 거야?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"타나는 어깨를 움츠렸다. \"\"내가 알고 있는 한 이건 허가된 임무가 아냐. 내 정보 소식통도 그녀에 대해서는 아무것도 몰라. 나름대로 "
"이유가 있어서 왔을 거야. 지금은 상황 가릴 때가 아니야.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"마티우스는 고개를 끄덕였다. 그 엘프는 눈여겨봐야 할 것이다. \"\"그런데 다른 두 사람은?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"리펜. 탈출한 노예. 젊지만 열정적인 노르드야. 열정의 소중함을 알잖아. 미리 말해 두겠는데, 그는 읽고 쓸 수 있고, 사냥이나 "
"식료 조달 능력도 그 나름대로 있다. 그동안 자기 힘으로 살아왔으니 기회를 줘.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"일꾼이 많은 건 나쁜 일이 아니고, 팀 규모가 작기 때문에 그 소년이 방해되는 일은 없을 것이다. 그래도 마티우스는 각오 없는 이들에게 "
"이 여행이 얼마나 힘든지 알고 있었기 때문에 안 좋은 기분이 들었다. \"\"그럼 세 번째는? 아직 안내인 이야기를 하지 않았잖아. "
"아르고니안 협력자 없이는 아무데도 못 가. 적어도 그 정도는 기억하고 있겠지.\"\" 마티우스는 방금 말한 걸 후회했지만, 타나는 "
"무시했다.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"리버 길스\"\"라고 그녀는 말했다. \"\"네가 의뢰한 대로, 경험이 풍부한 아르고니안 안내인이야. 조건은 하나뿐.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"조건이 있어?\"\" 마티우스는 한숨을 쉬었다. 내가 약속한 금액은 제시했어?\n"
"\n"
"\"\"했어. 마저 얘기하게 해 줘.\"\" 타나는 일단 이야기를 끊었다. 그를 기다리게 하는 것 같았다. \"\"리버 길스는 중간까지만 "
"안내해 줄 거야. 거기서부터는 네가 가고 싶은 곳을 절반의 시간 안에 데려다 주는, 다른 사람을 소개시켜 준다고 약속했어.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"분별 있는 사람이라면 거절할 것이라고 마티우스는 생각했지만 그럴 수 없다는 걸 알고 있었다. 아무리 가능성이 적더라도 다시 기회를 얻는 "
"것을 벌써 10년이나 기다려 왔다. 마티우스는 그 늪에는 숨은 길을 알고 있는, 그다지 사람 앞에 모습을 드러내지 않는 부족이 있다는 "
"얘기를 들어봤다. 그런 부족과 안전하게 접촉할 수 있다는 생각은 그를 대담하게 만들 정도로 매력적이었다.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"잘했어.\"\"라고 마티우스는 말했다. \"\"고마워, 타나.\"\" 그는 등을 돌리고 떠나려 했지만 문 앞에서 멈춰 섰다. "
"\"\"정말, 무슨 말을 해도 같이 가지 않을 거야? 역시 우리는 둘이 가야 해.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"말했잖아, 마티우스. 설령 전 세계의 골드를 받더라도 블랙 마쉬로 돌아가지 않을 거라고. 나야말로, 가지 말라고 널 설득하고 싶어."

"There's a lovable little vine-tongue sapling in your home. You know what to "
"feed it, where it likes to live, and how best to keep it entertained. To "
"avoid any mishaps and to reduce chaos in your life, here are three important "
"lessons I learned while raising my own vine-tongues.\n"
"\n"
"1) Remove other household pets until you have fully trained your vine-tongue."
" Give them over into the care of friends or distant family so as not to find "
"a hug or a cuddle turn into an inadvertent meal for your precocious little "
"vine-tongue. While affectionate, vine-tongues also tend to be in a constant "
"ravenous state. Take precautions and little Mixie will survive to purr "
"another day!\n"
"\n"
"2) Ignore the naysayers. Many people will tell you that keeping a vine-"
"tongue is dangerous. That carnivorous plants can't be trained or trusted. "
"Balderdash, I say! Tamed vine-tongues are sweet and misunderstood. Yes, they "
"can be dangerous, but so can eating lunch. It's possible to choke on your "
"next bite of rabbit meatballs, but no one is going to tell you not to eat!\n"
"\n"
"3) Even when fully trained, you need to maintain dominance over your vine-"
"tongue. These plants have a temper and can easily be offended, but if you "
"show even a modicum of hesitation or fear, they might pounce and treat you "
"like prey. They seek love and affection, so keep that in mind and everything "
"will work out fine. I'm almost positive!"

"When you return home after a long and grueling journey, you want a nice warm "

"the hot meal. They prefer their food raw and somewhat wiggly. Your vine-"
"tongue deserves the best, and it's your job to provide it for them.\n"
"\n"
"For maximum comfort, your vine-tongue prefers a humid climate on a patch of "
"soil surrounded by standing water. In addition, the area you designate as "
"your vine-tongue's lair needs to appeal to wandering creatures. Once your "
"beloved plant gets big enough, it will want to supplement the delicious diet "
"you provide with prey that it catches on its own. Not only does this give "
"your plant a sense of accomplishment, it helps keep your home free of vermin."
"\n"
"\n"
"Did you realize that vine-tongues make excellent sentries? Put them up high "
"where they can observe their surroundings and admire the sights. If anyone "
"tries to come near your property, your new friend will greet them "

"\n"
"The Black Marsh Exploration Society has a long and noble history of "
"sponsoring adventurers who are brave and hearty enough to survive the rigors "
"of the deep swamp. They must be strong, competent, and capable of unraveling "
"the many mysteries inherent in the expansive swamps and impenetrable "
"rainforests. Take, for example, the mystery of the miregaunt. A resolute and "
"steady head is required when facing an ambulatory piece of the marsh.\n"
"\n"
"Miregaunts aren't so rare that a visitor to Murkmire will never see one, but "
"they're also not so prevalent as to be a constant threat to "
"expeditions—though they do tend to congregate in and around places we like "
"to explore. These large, walking parts of the swamp appear vaguely humanoid "
"in shape, but without a discernible head. Consisting mainly of plant "
"substance, they sometimes incorporate other materials into their shape, "
"including mud, stone, vines, and even pieces of ancient architecture.\n"
"\n"
"As for the biology of these strange creatures, the society remains at a loss."
" They have some small resemblance to certain aspects of lurchers and similar "
"creatures found in other parts of Tamriel, but in all other respects they "
"appear totally unique creatures. Local legends associate the miregaunts with "
"Hist trees, but I must admit that the explanation was very hard to follow. "
"Some tribes believe that the Hist trees call forth a portion of the swamp to "
"accomplish a specific task, either guarding an area, defending a place, or "
"taking vengeance on someone or something that hurt or hampered the Hist in "
"some way. Others seem to indicate that a miregaunt is an unintended by-"
"product of some unknown Hist activity, called forth by accident and set "
"loose with no specific purpose in mind. Frankly, the contradictions I've "
"uncovered are quite maddening!\n"
"\n"
"What I can say with some degree of certainty is that every miregaunt has a "
"large cavity in its mid-section. Sometimes an encountered miregaunt's cavity "
"is empty. Other times a random piece of stone or other detritus fills the "
"empty space. In rare cases, something valuable rests within the miregaunt, "
"such as a precious stone, an ancient relic, or even a living creature. The "
"local Argonians believe that these valuable objects have been taken into the "
"miregaunt to purposely protect or imprison them. Fanciful, I know, but "
"that's what some of the tribes believe.\n"

"A dissertation on the oozes of the swamp by Concordia Mercius of Cyrodilic "
"Collections.\n"
"\n"
"I have yet to see one of these exotic oozes personally, but I have it on "
"good authority that voriplasms—those mobile puddles of slime and ooze—are "
"really quite extraordinary! After extensive research and interviews with "
"Murkmire locals, including our society's very own Jee-Lar, here are my "
"findings on the subject of voriplasms.\n"
"\n"
"The nature of the voriplasm remains something of a mystery. When encountered "
"in the wild, be it in a shallow marsh or along a grassy riverbed, a "
"voriplasm appears as nothing more than a puddle of thick and viscous green "
"slime. On closer examination, however, one will notice that the slime "
"doesn't spread and dissipate like a puddle. Instead, it holds its amorphous "
"shape and undulates in a most disquieting manner. Without any visible "
"sensory apparatus or internal organs of any kind, these remarkable blobs of "
"ooze move, hunt, and consume with great efficiency. In fact, Jee-Lar claims "
"to have seen a voriplasm take notice of a bantam guar that was more than "
"twenty paces distant, slide across the ground at a dizzying speed, and "
"engulf the poor creature before it even knew that it was in danger. Within "
"moments, the ooze had devoured its prey and ejected the remaining bones as "
"it slipped back into the pool where it had previously been sunning itself.\n"
"\n"
"From what I've been able to ascertain from the few scholarly works on the "
"subject, voriplasms appear to have a rudimentary intelligence. Certainly, "
"they recognize prey, avoid danger, and flee from stronger opponents, just "
"like most predatory creatures. They cluster in groups and often hunt in "
"packs as well as on their own. How they communicate remains a mystery, as "
"does the methods they use to interact with the world around them. Attempts "
"to dissect the creatures have not met with much success as yet, or so I've "
"been told.\n"
"\n"
"One scholar on the subject, Exerius Talos of the University of Gwylim, "
"speculates that voriplasms reproduce by growing to a large size and then "
"splitting apart to form new voriplasms. This seems to me to be an efficient "
"if somewhat solitary process as far as spawning goes, but it makes sense for "
"ambulatory blobs of slime. \n"
"\n"
"A more incredible theory concerns a seemingly related creature rumored to "
"roam the wilds of Murkmire—a creature called a voriplasmic corpse. Instead "
"of expelling the bones of prey after a voriplasm devours its flesh, the ooze "
"retains the skeleton and clings to it like a new layer of skin. When "
"encountered in the wild, they appear as skeletal bodies where the flesh has "
"melted from the bones and been replaced with voriplasmic slime. The "
"ambulatory nature of the voriplasmic corpses, despite their name, has "
"nothing to do with necromancy or some other supernatural occurrence. Like a "
"snail that occupies a shell, a voriplasm utilizes a captured skeleton to "
"give the ooze form and a more substantial definition. That, at least, is my "
"current theory. I hope to learn more and update this volume after I finally "
"get to participate in a Cyrodilic Collections expedition into the heart of "
"Murkmire."

"\n"
"Hi ho! If you've recently come into the possession of a swamp jelly, or are "
"considering owning them, then you've come to the right place! These little "
"tooters are some of the best companions a swamp traveler could ask for and "
"they're easy to herd if you're looking to keep livestock.\n"
"\n"
"Chances are you know a bit about swamp jellies already, but how about I go "
"over the basics to round out the gaps, yeah?\n"
"\n"
"Habitat:\n"
"Swamp jellies are a form of wildlife native to Black Marsh. They favor "
"wetlands close to the coasts—quite possibly they're distant relatives of the "
"jellies found out in the ocean—but swamp jellies thrive in any wet "
"environment. Even a sweaty boot, if you're in a pinch.\n"
"\n"
"Anatomy:\n"
"Like any other jelly, they have no bones or solid bits, just an elastic, "
"gelatinous body and limbs. Beyond that, their size, shape, and color vary "
"wildly between breeds. The most common type of jelly found in Murkmire has a "
"frilled, bulbous body from which four tentacles hang. Those tentacles help "
"the jelly navigate crowded spaces and capture prey, but most of the jelly's "
"movement is controlled by tiny orifices that suck in and expel swamp gas "
"from several bladders. I'm not really certain how the swamp jellies became "
"airborne, but my theory is that sea jellies got washed inland by storms and "
"survived in the swamp pools. Eventually their bladders accumulated enough "
"swamp gas to lift them clear out of the water!\n"
"\n"
"Behavior:\n"
"Swamp jellies are incredibly docile by nature, spending most of their time "
"gently floating on the breeze and catching unsuspecting bugs to eat. Swamp "
"jellies tend to lead solitary lives, really only coming together in any "
"number to spawn, but they are social animals. These little tooters make "
"complex calls to each other using their gas bladders. You'll find them no "
"less talkative to you if you take one into your care and if you learn a few "
"of these calls you can even teach swamp jellies simple obedience! It's a "
"useful skill whether you're an enthusiast or a herder.\n"
"\n"
"Diet:\n"
"Airborne swamp jellies subsist entirely on bugs, mostly of the flying "
"variety, but any teeny critter that brushes against their sticky tentacles "
"is fair game. I've seen a single swamp jelly eat as many as a thousand bugs "
"in a day. That alone is reason enough to make one your travel companion in a "
"place like Black Marsh. I recommend taking your herd out to graze in "
"different locations at least three times a week. Jellies kept to one "
"location for too long will wipe out the local insect population in a few "
"days! If you happen to be short on bugs, a hearty spoonful of scrib jelly "
"makes a suitable substitute.\n"
"\n"
"Care:\n"
"Swamp jellies need humidity to survive. If your clothes aren't sticking to "
"you, it's probably too dry for a jelly to stay for more than a couple of "
"hours without help. Swamp jellies don't need to drink, but they can suck up "
"water from a bowl or wide-mouthed vessel if they can't get the moisture they "
"need from the air. Brackish water is best, but fresh or salt water is safe.\n"
"\n"
"Provide a steady supply of bugs throughout the day when you can, rather than "
"feeding only at certain times. Hungry swamp jellies tend to binge, weighing "
"them down and making them sluggish.\n"
"\n"
"Try not to worry if your swamp jelly suffers injury. They will heal cuts and "
"even regrow limbs given time. You should only be concerned if your jelly is "
"struggling to keep afloat. You may need to feed the poor little tooter by "
"hand until its bladders can hold gas again.\n"
"\n"
"Even if you take my advice to heart, sooner or later, we've all got to say "
"goodbye to our little tooters. Wild swamp jellies tend to live between two "
"and three years, but domesticated swamp jellies can live as long as five "
"years with good care.\n"
"\n"
"Meal Preparation:\n"
"Whether you're keeping a swamp jelly as a pet or rearing them for slaughter, "
"careful butchery is key to making sure their little gelatinous bodies don't "
"go to waste. You'll want to grease your hands with cooking oil before "
"handling swamp jellies, otherwise they'll stick to your fingers and you "
"might end up pulling them apart trying to free yourself. Most of the time "
"you'll want to remove any tentacles from the body and put them aside for "
"later use. Just lay them out straight across your cutting board and slice "
"across. Once you've removed the limbs, you're ready to spit the body "
"straight down the middle. I recommend using a cleaver and some firm "
"pressure, but anything sharp will do. Oily jellies, hands, and knives are a "
"recipe for finger sandwiches if you aren't careful!\n"
"\n"
"After you wash out the body cavities, your jelly is ready for roasting over "
"open fire or in an oven. Over red coals you'll get a firmer jelly with a bit "
"of crisp on the outside. I usually cook the tentacles in the body and slurp "
"them down with eel broth, but you can roast them on skewers in about ten "
"minutes for a salty treat. Swamp jelly makes a good substitute for brain or "
"scrib jelly in your recipes, if you're watching your weight.\n"
"\n"
"Catching Jellies:\n"
"If you're looking to tame your own wild jellies, get yourself a fine net—bug "
"nets work best. Scoop the jellies gently into your net and you're done. Most "
"swamp jellies are so harmless they won't even protest. There are a few "
"breeds in the Deepmire that are so poisonous they'll kill you if you even "
"brush their tentacles, but no need to worry about them.\n"
"\n"
"That's really all there is to know about catching and caring for your swamp "
"jellies, anything else is just jam on the jelly-cakes!"

"여어! 만약 최근 늪지 해파리를 손에 넣었거나, 소유하려고 생각하고 있다면, 여기에 온 것은 정답이야! 이 작은 뿡뿡이들은 늪을 여행하는 "
"자에게는 바랄 것도 없는 최상급 동료니까. 가축을 기르려 하면 무리를 짓기도 쉽지.\n"
"\n"
"어쩌면 벌써 늪지 해파리에 대해 약간은 알지도 모르지만 빠진 부분을 메우기 위해 기본적인 것부터 다시 한 번 검토해 보면 어떨까?\n"
"\n"
"서식지:\n"
"늪지 해파리는 블랙 마쉬 고유의 야생생물의 일종이야. 해안에 가까운 습지대를 선호하지. 바다에 있는 해파리의 먼 친척일 가능성이 매우 "
"높아.하지만, 늪지 해파리는 어떠한 습한 환경에서도 건강하게 자라. 필요하다면 땀이 나는 부츠 안도 괜찮아.\n"
"\n"
"몸의 구조:\n"
"다른 해파리처럼 이들에겐 뼈도 고체화된 부분도 없어. 단지 탄성이 있고 젤리 같은 몸과 다리가 있을 뿐이야. 그 외의 크기, 형상, 색상 "
"등은 종류에 따라 크게 달라. 마크마이어에서 볼 수 있는 가장 일반적인 해파리는 주름이 있는 공 모양의 몸을 가졌고 거기에 4개의 촉수가 "
"달려 있어. 이들 촉수는 해파리가 복잡한 장소를 이동해 사냥감을 잡는 데 도움이 되지만 해파리의 움직임 대부분은 몇몇 부낭으로 늪의 "
"가스를 빨아들여 뿜어내는 작은 구멍으로 제어하고 있어. 어떻게 늪지 해파리가 떠 있을 수 있는지 확실히는 모르지만, 나의 이론은 바다 "
"해파리가 폭풍우로 내륙으로 옮겨져 늪지대의 웅덩이에서 살아남았다는 거야. 결국, 그들의 부낭은 물 밖으로 떠오를 수 있을 만큼 충분히 "
"늪의 가스를 축적했다는 거지!\n"
"\n"
"습성:\n"
"늪지 해파리는 믿을 수 없을 만큼 순하고, 대부분의 시간을 조용히 산들바람에 떠다니며, 아무것도 모르는 벌레를 잡아 먹으며 보내. 늪지 "
"해파리는 단독으로 생활하는 경향이 있고 많이 모이는 것은 산란 때뿐이지만 사회적인 동물이야. 이 작은 뿡뿡이는 부낭의 가스를 사용해서 "
"복잡한 울음소리로 서로를 불러. 1마리만 길러도 정말 수다스럽다니까. 그리고 그 울음소리를 조금 배우면, 늪지 해파리한테 간단한 지시를 "
"보낼 수도 있어! 이건 애호가들에게도, 사육자에게도 매우 도움이 되는 기술이야.\n"
"\n"
"미끼:\n"
"공중에 떠다니는 늪지 해파리는 날아다니는 종류의 벌레를 먹는데, 그들의 달라붙는 촉수에 부딪치는 온갖 작은 생물이 훌륭한 먹이가 되지. "
"나는 하루에 천마리의 벌레를 먹는 늪지 해파리를 본 적이 있어. 그것만으로도 블랙 마쉬 같은 장소에서 늪지 해파리를 동료로 만들 이유가 "
"충분해. 적어도 일주일에 3번은 다른 곳에 해파리 떼를 풀어 놓는 걸 추천해. 1곳에 해파리들을 오래 두다 보면 며칠만에 그 지역의 "
"곤충을 쓸어버릴 테니까! 벌레가 모자라면 애정 어린 스크립 젤리 한 숟가락이 적절한 대용품이지.\n"
"\n"
"관리:\n"
"늪지 해파리가 살기에는 습기가 필요해. 옷이 몸에 달라붙지 않을 정도라면 해파리가 아무런 도움 없이 몇 시간 이상 지내기에는 너무 "
"건조하지. 늪지 해파리는 마실 것을 필요로 하지 않지만, 공기중으로부터 필요한 수분을 얻을 수 없는 경우에는, 사발이나 입이 넓은 "
"그릇으로부터 물을 흡수할 수 있어. 염분 섞인 물이 가장 좋지만 담수든 바닷물이든 문제없어.\n"
"\n"
"특정 시간에만 먹이를 주기보다는, 가능하면 하루 종일, 안정적으로 벌레를 공급하는 게 좋아. 굶주린 늪지 해파리는 폭식을 하는 경향이 "
"있고 몸이 무거워지고 느릿느릿해져.\n"
"\n"
"늪지 해파리가 다쳤다 하더라도 걱정하지 마. 이들은 상처를 치유하고 시간이 지나면 다리 재생까지 해. 늪지 해파리가 계속 떠오르려 하지 "
"않는지만 신경쓰면 돼. 그 불쌍한 뿡뿡이가 부낭에 가스를 채울 때까지 손으로 먹이를 줘야 해.\n"
"\n"
"설령 나의 조언을 명심하더라도, 늦더라도 언젠가 작은 뿡뿡이와는 이별을 해야 해. 야생의 늪지 해파리는 2년부터 3년 정도의 수명이지만, "
"가축화된 늪지 해파리는 제대로 돌보면 5년 정도 살아.\n"
"\n"
"요리 준비:\n"
"애완동물로서 기르고 있든, 식량용으로 기르고 있든 이들의 작은 젤리 모양 몸을 낭비하지 않으려면 꼼꼼한 해체가 중요해. 늪지 해파리를 "
"만지기 전에는 손에 식용유를 바르는 게 좋아. 그렇지 않으면 손가락에 달라붙어 버려서, 손을 떼려다가 해파리가 뿔뿔이 찢겨질 가능성이 "
"있어. 대부분의 경우, 몸에서 촉수를 떼어내고 나중에 사용하기 위해 분리하는 것이 좋아. 도마 위에 똑바로 놓고 옆으로 잘라. 발을 "
"자르면, 몸 한가운데를 분리해. 큰 칼로 세게 다지는 걸 권장하지만 날카로운 것이라면 무엇이든 좋아. 조심하지 않으면 기름진 해파리랑 "
"손을 같이 잘라서 손가락 샌드위치가 만들어질 수도 있어!\n"
"\n"
"몸 속의 구멍을 씻으면 해파리를 직화 또는 오븐에 굽을 준비는 완료야. 붉어진 숯 위에서 해파리의 몸은 조금 딱딱해져. 바깥쪽은 조금 "
"바삭바삭하지. 보통 나는 촉수를 몸 안에 넣어서 조리한 후 장어 스프와 함께 마시지만, 꼬챙이에 꿰고 10분 정도 구워서 간식으로 먹어도 "
"좋아. 체중에 신경쓴다면 늪지 해파리는 요리법에 있는 뇌나 스크립 젤리의 좋은 대용품이 되지.\n"
"\n"
"해파리 포획:\n"
"만약 야생 해파리를 길들인다면 고급 그물을 준비해. 가장 좋은 건 벌레잡이 그물이야. 해파리를 그물 안으로 다정하게 밀어넣으면 끝이야. "
"대부분의 늪지 해파리는 무해하고 저항도 하지 않아. 딥마이어에는 촉수를 가볍게 만져도 죽음에 이르는 아주 강한 독을 가진 품종이 약간 "
"있지만 이에 대해서는 걱정하지 않아도 돼.\n"
"\n"
"늪지 해파리의 포획과 돌보는 것에 대해 알아야 할 것은 정말 전부야. 다른 건 해파리 케이크에 잼을 바르는 것뿐이야!"

"Beeko : Friend. Variations include: Deek-Beeko, Raj-Beeko, Beek-Ojel, and "
"Uxith-Beeko.\n"
"\n"
"Bok: Bowl; deep, round dish or a rounded, cuplike hollow.\n"
"\n"
"Deelith: Teacher, or more accurately, one who passes wisdom to another. A "
"very honored title for any to be granted.\n"
"\n"
"Greel: Enemy. Rarely used to describe other tribes, as the Saxhleel are "
"believed to be one people under many Hists. More commonly used against "

"Kaal: War captain. The more violent the tribe, the more this title is "

"Krona: Big, colossal. Often used as a point of exaggeration or jest, such "
"as, \"\"Look at the krona feet on him!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Lukiul: An Argonian that has assimilated into a non-Argonian culture. They "
"are often treated as outsiders by the natives of Black Marsh.\n"

"Naheesh: Tribal elder. Though respected, this title does not dictate a "
"position of power (as some scholars may suggest).\n"
"\n"
"Nalpa: Bad. A more literal translation is \"\"rotten,\"\" but it can be used "
"to dictate poor workmanship, a vile character, a poorly cooked meal, etc.\n"
"\n"
"Norg: Forbidden. A little used word in my culture, as most forbidden things "

"\n"
"Thuxis: Snake. Also used to describe people who have taken to trickery to "
"accomplish their goals.\n"
"\n"
"Toteik: Great. A little used word, as it denotes a very strong opinion on a "
"given subject manner. To be used sparingly, if at all.\n"
"\n"
"Tsona: Swim. (As a note, I do not recommend swimming within the swamps of "

"Xal: Sacred. Often used in conjunction with other words or phrases. An "
"example would be the Xinchei-Konu, a monument noted to create xal-vastei.\n"
"\n"
"Xeech: Nut, seed. Also the beginning, birth, something with unreleased "
"potential.\n"
"\n"
"Xul: Death, or pertaining to death. Also known as rebirth, for they are "
"thought to be one and the same in the eyes of my people.\n"

"I have listened to all the stories, talked to all the tale-tellers and "
"elders. After many seasons of searching and investigation, I have come to "
"the conclusion that the ancestor of my egg family led the Imperial Ninth "
"Legion to the Tsofeer Caverns. That's where they all disappeared into "
"history and became the Lost Legion.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Many of the stories involving the Tsofeer Caverns mention a massive and "
"powerful voriplasm known as the Wuju-Ka. From what I could ascertain, this "
"huge pool of malevolent slime behaves unlike other voriplasms. It creates "
"extensions of itself, mobile puddles of ooze that remain connected to it in "
"some manner, serving as its eyes, ears, and appendages—its connection to the "
"world outside its spawning pool. The elders I spoke to talked about the Wuju-"
"Ka in reverent terms, but they were also clearly afraid of the creature. "
"They said that in ancient seasons, elders from nearby tribes would go to the "
"Tsofeer Caverns and perform a binding ritual to trap the massive voriplasm "
"and its extensions inside the caves.\n"
"\n"
"The binding ritual hasn't been performed in many, many seasons. Not since a "
"rock slide sealed the entrance to the Tsofeer Caverns. I wonder if that was "
"when the Ninth Legion was lost? Were they somehow trapped inside the caves?\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Here's what I learned about voriplasms. These slime creatures slither "
"through the swamp, consuming whatever gets in their way. To spawn, they "
"either split apart and form new voriplasms, or they turn consumed flesh into "
"voriplasmic corpses. Voriplasmic corpses appear as skeletal bodies, the "
"flesh melted from their bones and replaced with voriplasmic slime. These "
"disgusting, shambling creatures have some connection to the voriplasm that "
"spawned them, but not to the degree associated with the Wuju-Ka.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"One elder was willing to teach me the binding ritual for the Wuju-Ka. At "
"least, she taught me what the elders before her told her. I hope the Wuju-Ka "
"no longer exists, but if it still occupies the Tsofeer Caverns, then I must "
"perform the binding ritual before I leave the caves. I just hope I can also "
"find proof of the Lost Legion and some evidence to exonerate my ancestor and "
"clear the mark of traitor that has sullied my egg-family's name."

"By Jekka-Wass Paxalt, Keeper of the Xinchei-Konu\n"
"\n"
"Time is immutable. An engine that drives the will of change, inevitable, "
"primordial. An ever-moving force in an ever-constant cycle. To mark the "
"progression of that change is a thing most sacred to the Saxhleel. Each "
"month marks a particular aspect of the yearly cycle, and is thus celebrated "
"accordingly. The months and their respective meanings are as follows:\n"
"\n"
"Vakka (Sun)\n"
"As the first month of the cycle, Vakka is associated with the primordial "
"origin of existence, or origins in general. We are encouraged to show extra "
"respect to the tribal elders during this time.\n"
"\n"
"Xeech (Nut)\n"
"Also known as the hiding time, Xeech is a month of planting both seeds and "
"ideals. Swamp bulbs are buried, planting sprouts. Elders pass down their "
"knowledge, implanting knowledge. This is a time of hope, but also of "
"melancholy. It is the first of the Three Mournings, for once a thing it is "
"planted, it is hidden and gone. What emerges will not be something new: the "
"nut is lost forever.\n"
"\n"
"Sisei (Sprout)\n"
"Sisei stands for newness, possibility, and youthful excitement. The Hist has "
"shed its sleeping life and now is truly alive. Many hatchling festivals take "
"place during this time. It is also known as the \"\"leaping season,\"\" for "
"this month is also full of sport and competition. The virtues of strength, "
"speed, and willpower are all venerated and celebrated.\n"
"\n"
"Hist-Deek (Hist Sapling)\n"
"Hist-Deek is, for good or ill, dedicated to the challenge of authority and "
"the power of individual agency. Many use this month to highlight injustices, "
"with intra-tribal conflict often resulting. Needless to say, it is a very "
"controversial time. Many also take this time to analyze their agency apart "
"from the Hist; to reflect upon our worship, and see it as bond rather than "
"bondage.\n"
"\n"
"Hist-Dooka (Mature Hist)\n"
"Serving as the counter-balance to the turbulent Hist-Deek, the Hist-Dooka is "
"centered on the ideas of family, tradition, and obligation. Young Saxhleel "
"are given more responsibility, and many adolescents take on the Chukka-Sei, "
"a trial of maturation, to prove themselves worthy of being called an adult. "
"Those who pass the trials are gain full tribal membership, and the month "
"typically ends with a great celebration.\n"
"\n"
"Hist-Tsoko (Elder Hist)\n"
"Perhaps the holiest month of the year, Hist-Tsoko is dedicated to the ideas "
"of knowledge, wisdom, and fullness of potential. Many gatherings this month "
"are solemn affairs, the most important being the Root Talk, where the tribal "
"elders recite the history of the Saxhleel. This month also stands as the "
"Second Mourning, due to the fact that the Hist has stopped growing and all "
"of its individual potential is expended.\n"
"\n"
"Thtithil-Gah (Egg-Basket)\n"
"Thtithil-Gah is a month of foolishness and frivolity, often a welcome "
"respite from the oppressive solemnity of the Hist-Tsoko. Hatchling-like "
"wonder, youthful joy, and mild confusion are all venerated. Many traveling "
"entertaining troupes make the majority of their profit during this time. "
"Festivals and feasts are nearly constant.\n"
"\n"
"Thtithil (Egg)\n"
"The Egg month is associated with mystery, anticipation, and (perhaps oddly) "
"finality. For most tribes, the connection is literal; much egg-laying takes "
"place during this month.\n"
"\n"
"Nushmeeko (Lizard)\n"
"The lizard symbolizes swift and quiet labor. Nushmeeko celebrates the "
"thankless tasks of everyday life, and work is near constant. Cleaning, "
"building, repairing, and preparing; every member of the tribe puts their "
"snout to the grindstone and pushes.\n"
"\n"
"Shaja-Nushmeeko (Semi-Humanoid Lizard) \n"
"This month, like Hist-Deek earlier, is another of mystery and debate. There "
"is significant controversy about what the humanoid-lizard actually "
"represents. Is it a hatchling emerged from the egg, or a representation of "
"our cultural origins? Unifying concepts such as change, becoming, and "
"shifting values are all contemplated. Appropriately, many adolescent "
"gatherings take place during this time, resulting in various romantic "
"entanglements. The awkwardness of youth is often associated with this month.\n"
"\n"
"Saxhleel (Argonian)\n"
"Saxhleel is a month associated with the true passions of our culture. Given "
"that the hunting and harvesting season has passed, tribe members are free to "
"focus on pursuits such as pottery, woodcarving, and other creative pastimes. "
"A sense of things coming to a close is pervasive, and in many tribes there "
"is a large gathering of elders at the end of this month. The intent of the "
"festival is to prepare both our elders and community for the impending "
"deaths to come. Dryskins often find this a morbid tradition.\n"
"\n"
"Xulomaht (The Deceased)\n"
"Like many traditions, Xulomaht is a month of apparently conflicting ideas. "
"It is associated with the Third Mourning, the most powerful of the three "
"given the literal ending of the year. Tribes look back on the events of the "
"year and come to terms with its passing. However, it is also a time of "
"celebration and remembrances. Great festivals are held in honor of all who "
"have passed from their old life and into a new one. Much of the month is "
"spent planning and preparing for these festivities."

"의지력의 미덕이 모두 존중되고 축하를 받는다.\n"
"\n"
"히스트 딕 (히스트의 수액)\n"
"히스트 딕은 좋든 나쁘든 권위에 대한 반항과 개별 기관의 힘에 헌신한다. 많은 사람들은 이 달을 이용해 비리를 고발하고 그 결과로 종종 "
"부족 내부의 다툼이 일어난다. 말할 것도 없이 논쟁의 대상이 되는 일이 많은 달이다. 많은 사람들은 이때 히스트와 얼마나 떨어져 "
"있었는지를 분석한다. 숭배에 대해 반성하고, 그것이 결속이지 속박이 아님을 이해하기 위해서이다.\n"
"\n"
"히스트 두카 (성숙한 히스트)\n"
"격동의 히스트 딕을 상쇄하는 역할을 맡은 히스트 두카는 가족, 전통, 의무 같은 관념을 중심으로 둔다. 젊은 색스릴에게는 더 많은 책임이 "
"주어지고, 많은 젊은이들은 측카 세이, 즉 성인의 시련에 도전하여 스스로 어른으로 불리기에 적합함을 증명한다. 시련을 돌파한 자는 완전한 "

"히스트 초코 (연로한 히스트)\n"
"아마 일년 중에서 가장 신성한 달인 히스트 초코는 지식과 현명함, 가능성의 충만함이라는 관념에 헌신하고 있다. 이 달에 열리는 집회의 "
"대부분은 엄숙한 행사이고 그중 가장 중요한 것은 부족장로들이 색스릴의 역사를 암송하는 뿌리의 말이다. 이 달은 또 히스트가 성장을 멈추고 "
"모든 개별 잠재력이 소모된다는 사실 때문에 두 번째 애도의 달로 기록된다.\n"
"\n"
"스티실 가 (알바구니)\n"
"스티실 가는 어리석고 경박한 달이며, 보통 히스트 초코의 답답한 엄숙함에서 벗어나 환영받는 휴식의 달이다. 아이 같은 놀라움, 젊음의 "
"환희, 가벼운 혼란 등이 축하대상이 된다. 많은 여행 오락단이 이익의 대부분을 이 시기에 얻는다. 축제나 연회는 거의 끊임없이 이어진다.\n"
"\n"
"스티실 (알)\n"
"알의 달은 수수께끼나 기대, 그리고(약간 이상하지만) 결말성과 연관되어 있다. 대부분의 부족에게 있어서, 이 연관성은 문자 그대로의 "
"의미이다. 산란의 대부분은 이 달에 일어난다.\n"
"\n"
"누슈미코 (도마뱀)\n"
"도마뱀은 조용하고 재빠른 노동의 상징이다. 누슈미코는 일상생활에서 감사할 줄 모르는 일을 축하하며, 노동은 거의 끊임없이 이루어진다. "
"청소,건축, 복원, 준비 등을 하고, 부족의 일원은 모두 오로지 일만 한다.\n"
"\n"
"샤자 누슈미코 (반인 도마뱀)\n"
"이 달은 히스트 딕처럼 수수께끼와 논의가 끊이지 않는 달이다. 반인 도마뱀이 실제로 무엇을 표현하고 있는지에 대해서는 상당한 논란이 있다."
"알에서 나온 아이의 이야기인가, 아니면 우리 문명의 기원을 나타내는 것인가? 변화나 생성, 옮겨가는 가치와 같은 통합적 개념이 모두 "
"고려된다. 그 때문에 많은 젊은이들의 집회가 이 시기에 열리며, 여러가지 연애에 관한 일이 이루어진다. 젊은이의 혈기는 종종 이 달과 "
"연관이 있다.\n"
"\n"
"색스릴 (아르고니안)\n"
"색스릴은 우리 문화의 진정한 열정과 관련된 달이다. 사냥과 수확의 계절이 지난 지금 부족원들은 도예와 목공, 기타 창조적인 활동을 "
"자유롭게 할 수 있다. 매사가 끝나가고 있다는 의식이 퍼진다. 많은 부족에서는 이달 말에 원로들의 큰 집회가 있다. 이 축제의 목적은 "
"우리 장로들과 주민들에게 닥칠 죽음을 미리 준비하고자 하는 것이다. 피부가 마른 사람들은 이것을 음산한 전통으로 보는 시각도 많다.\n"
"\n"
"줄로마트 (고인)\n"
"많은 전통과 마찬가지로 줄로마트는 분명히 모순되는 발상의 달이다. 이 달은 세 번째 애도의 달과 관련이 있다. 말 그대로 한해의 끝이기 "
"때문에 세 번의 애도의 달 가운데 가장 강력하다. 부족은 한 해의 일을 되돌아 보고, 지나가는 것을 받아들인다. 그러나 이 달은 축하와 "
"추억의 시기다 .낡은 삶을 끝내고 새 생으로 옮겨간 모든 이들에게 경의를 표하기 위해 대규모 축제가 열린다. 한 달의 대부분은 이런 축제 "

"Our Hist recognizes the waste, the selfishness of the other tribes. They "

"of the deep mire. They forget that withered roots swell with life given the "
"right care. I will find a purpose for these hollow shells and our Hist will "
"again wind its roots around a bountiful clutch.\n"
"—\n"
"Failures. Many failures. It was to be expected. Breathing true life into "
"these hollow eggs will not be so simple as coaxing discarded flesh to "
"remember the act of living.\n"
"—\n"
"The Black-Tongue elixirs goad the eggs' growth, but it is a wild, "
"uncontrolled thing. Tumorous lumps of primordial flesh are a far cry from "
"what I seek, but they are life. What it needs is a guide. I know what must "
"be done.\n"
"—\n"
"I see the beginnings of what could have been Saxhleel. At first a tooth, or "
"a scale, or a spine among the formless masses that hatch from the eggs. The "
"sap knows what to do, but elements are still missing. In time I will know "
"the answer to this puzzle.\n"
"—\n"
"I have created life. Short-lived, but life all the same. The Saxhleel that "
"hatched are malformed and few survived beyond a matter of hours, but I am on "
"the correct path.\n"
"—\n"
"As I hatch more and more of these eggs, I now understand just how far I am "
"from what I seek. Every peak I overcome reveals a mountain taller than the "
"last. Advancing the growth of the hatchlings has given them the constitution "
"to endure, but even as I eliminate many of their physical deformities, it "
"becomes clear that they are hollow. Saxhleel only in form. I must remind "
"myself that each one brings me one step closer to the goal.\n"
"—\n"
"We have had to cage the Hollow that survive their hatching. Some possess an "
"instinct, if not an intellect. They seem drawn to something we can't see and "
"respond with hostility to any interference. Even the lame ones require far "
"too much diligence to adequately watch. I suspect I've lost more than one "
"already, but I can hardly keep track of so many failures.\n"
"—\n"
"I will count today a triumph, if not a victory. Combining Veeskhleel rituals "
"with my alchemy has produced a healthy Saxhleel. It is docile compared to "

"unfit for inhabitation.\n"

"You need to gather the following frogs so I can complete construction of a "

"\n"
"We need moss-foot croakers, ruby hoppers, indigo tree frogs, and sun-blessed "
"toads. Those are the ones that produce the widest range of sounds.\n"
"\n"
"First, find a few of the green moss-foot croakers in the bushes that grow in "
"the marsh east of Lilmoth. They are quite docile and easy to catch.\n"
"\n"
"Second, look for the ruby hoppers. These rare, red frogs, like to sun "
"themselves on stones near water around Lilmoth. You have to sneak up on "
"them, though, or they get frightened and hop away. If that happens, the "
"scared hoppers often hide by the big tree at the center of town.\n"
"\n"
"Catching indigo tree frogs is a little more complicated. After you locate "
"the trees where they nest, you need to gather some fleshflies. The blue "
"frogs love them! Release the fleshflies beneath the tree. When the frogs hop "
"down to feast, just grab them.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, sun-blessed toads will prove to be the most difficult of the frogs "
"to catch. To lure them out of their mud pit, you need to trick them into "
"thinking it's time to mate. To do that, you first need to gather the "
"ingredients to make a scent that will attract the frogs and draw them out of "
"hiding.\n"
"\n"
"To make the scent, you need to gather the following plants: stench sedge, "
"salt rush, and joymallow. Then combine them to create toad musk. Once you "
"have the musk, locate a toad mud pit. Then pour the toad musk onto yourself "
"and use the croak-wheel. Between the scent of the musk and the croaks "
"emerging from the wheel, you are sure to attract sun-blessed toads that you "
"can catch.\n"

"This year will be different. I've started chewing dragonthorn like we used "
"to in the old times. If I keep that up along with my tinctures for the "
"months to come. I should be ready for the bonding. It'll be me this year. I "
"know it.\n"
"—\n"
"I'm so embarrassed. The dragonthorn is pungent. It's made my breath sour and "
"the others have begun to notice. Even Mimme seems reluctant to talk to me. I "
"complained of having bad salamander, but I'm going to have to be more "
"discreet in chewing my herbs.\n"
"—\n"
"I feel like it's working. I think my scales and claws are looking shinier. "
"That's a good sign, I think. My teeth are staining yellow though. I've "
"started drinking brewed scaldroot to clean my mouth. It tastes like death, "
"but I think it'll help my teeth.\n"
"—\n"
"Keenum accidentally took a sip of my scaldroot tea and nearly passed out. I "
"had to work his watch at the uxith, so I couldn't get out to the dragonthorn "
"patch until after dark. I was approached in the dark by a woman whose scales "
"were so pale, especially under the moonlight. I almost screamed from fright, "
"but she spoke warmly to me. She asked why I was picking dragonthorn in the "
"dark of night and, I don't know why, but I told her the truth. I don't know "
"why I would admit such a thing to a stranger. Maybe it's because she's a "
"stranger. There's no one in the village I can speak to about it without a "
"look of impotent pity. I spoke to the stranger long into the night. We "
"agreed to meet again.\n"
"—\n"
"I've gotten so little sleep lately, but I can't help it. Ree-Nakal tells me "
"she can only visit me in the night and I spend all day thinking about seeing "
"her again. She understands my pain and it's such a relief to have someone "
"who can listen. I don't feel the shame I do when the subject comes up at "
"home. Ree-Nakal is one of the Veeskhleel, the Ghost People. I never expected "
"her to be so nice. The Bright-Throats don't deal with them. Not many tribes "
"do. They are treated like pariahs because they take eggs, but it can't be "
"helped. They can't bear clutches themselves, so their Hist sends them to "
"find others. It's so sad.\n"
"—\n"
"I talked to Ree-Nakal about the bonding. I suggested that maybe the Bright-"
"Throats could make an arrangement with the Ghost People for bonding rights, "
"so they wouldn't have to steal eggs anymore. She thanked me, but it was just "
"out of politeness. I could see it in her eyes that she held little hope of "
"our tribes becoming allies. She said our bond was a unique one and it will "
"have to be enough. I didn't press the matter. I didn't want to become for "
"her what my tribe has become for me. I won't pity her.\n"
"—\n"
"It's a sad day. It's always a sad day when we learn which eggs will return "
"to the Hist. Why does the Hist choose some eggs over others? I understand "
"the eggs that are clearly unwell, but we can't always predict which will go "
"on to hatch and which will sink in to the roots. I've always accepted that "
"there's nothing we can do for them, but Ree-Nakal tells me that's not true. "
"They can still be hatched. She offered to help me save them, if I can get "
"the eggs to her. My tribe wouldn't even miss them. They've already given up "
"on those children, but I won't. I'll care for them. They'll be our children.\n"
"—\n"
"I was supposed to work with Keenam again tonight, but I spiked his drink "
"with scaldroot extract. I should be able to slip away with a few eggs "
"throughout the night. It's terrifying to think about, but those eggs need me."
" I won't give up because I'm scared.\n"
"—\n"
"I did it. My skin was dry as dead bark when the morning watch came to "
"relieve me. I told them that a few of the eggs returned to the Hist in the "
"night and they just nodded and accepted it. I got a lump in my throat at how "
"little the news bothered them. \n"
"—\n"
"It took me hours to fall asleep. I thought that the Tree-Minder would come "
"and accuse me, but as I woke for my next watch, everything was perfectly "
"normal. Does the Hist know what I've done?\n"
"—\n"
"I've given Ree-Nakal nearly all the unfit eggs from our last clutch. There "
"were so many when I think about it. Such a waste, but not now. She told me "
"that the eggs I'd already brought to her are safely in nests under the watch "
"of her tribe's folk and doing well. She doesn't think it wise for me to "
"leave and see them just yet. Better to wait until after I've saved the last "
"of the eggs. That shouldn't be much longer I think. I can barely keep my "
"quill steady when I think about it.\n"
"—\n"
"My children are doing well, or so I'm told. I haven't been able to see my "
"eggs yet. I'm reminded of their absence every day as I tend to the eggs in "
"my village. I want to tend to my clutch. I'm their mother. Is this how the "
"others feel when we are raising their eggs?\n"
"—\n"
"Ree-Nakal tells me the clutch is nearly hatched! I told her I want to be "
"there for it, but she says it's not the time. The bonding ritual is coming "
"again soon, and I would be missed. I don't care though. The tribe can do "
"without me, but not those eggs. They need me!\n"
"— \n"
"I haven't seen Ree-Nakal since we fought. I'm afraid she won't come back. If "
"she doesn't, I don't know what I'll do. I don't know where to find her. I "
"don't know where my children are! All I wanted was to see them!"

"I should have known that our good fortune wouldn't last. After our pleasant "
"respite in the company of the Miredancers, we decided to press northward. "
"Our guide, Reelus, urged us to reconsider. \"\"The deep murk devours "
"outsiders,\"\" she said. She reminded us of the incident at Keel-Sakka "
"bridge, and explained that the northern natives are even less willing to "
"barter than the Tum-Taleel. Many of us were willing to cut the expedition "
"short, but in the end, we were outvoted.\n"
"\n"
"It did not take long for us to realize our folly. As we ventured northward, "
"the vegetation grew thicker by the hour. The small swarms of flesh-flies "
"we'd encountered before swelled into great, billowing clouds of buzzing pain."
" Again and again, Reelus encouraged us to turn back, but we continued to "
"trudge farther into the dark.\n"
"\n"
"Early Morndas morning, we noticed that Percius was missing. We fanned out to "
"find him—shouting and stumbling through the thick mud for over an hour. When "
"we reconvened at the wagons, we realized that Valentina and Morten had "
"disappeared as well. I feel no shame in saying our misguided bravery melted "
"away quickly. We turned the wagons immediately, moving southward as quickly "
"as the swamp would allow. That's when we started hearing the croaking.\n"
"\n"
"It was quiet at first—like a small gathering of frogs. Slowly, it grew "
"louder. After an hour of panicked marching, the sound had swelled into an "
"almost deafening cacophony. Then came the screaming. I couldn't say whose "
"voice it was. All I can say for sure is that it came from a place of total "
"agony. I saw shadows moving through the trees around us, but never for more "
"than an instant. I only got a good look at one of them. Reelus tells me it "
"was almost certainly a naga—a member of the terrifying Naga-Kur. Apparently, "
"the members of this Dead-Water tribe control vast swaths of northern "
"Murkmire and are greatly feared by Saxhleel in surrounding villages.\n"
"\n"
"As for the one I saw, I will never forget her. Her face resembled a snake of "
"some kind, and her entire body was covered in mud. What struck me most, "
"however, was her shield. It had a face! Reelus tells me that the Naga-Kur "
"often adorn their weapons and armor with pieces of fallen comrades. Faces, "
"claws, leg bones and the like. I winced at the idea of butchering a fallen "
"friend, but Reelus just shrugged. \"\"Naga-Kur fight all the days of their "
"lives. This lets them fight after death too.\"\" It makes sense. I guess.\n"
"Luckily, we escaped without any other losses. We won't soon forget the Naga-"
"Kur, though. Of that I am certain."

"Members of the Imperial Council,\n"
"\n"
"First, I want to thank you again for offering me this opportunity to serve "
"the Empire. I will do everything in my power to constantly be worthy of your "
"faith in me.\n"
"\n"
"Second, it has come to my attention that certain members of the council have "

"Fourth Legion of Black Marsh. \"\"Why conquer a damn swamp when there are "
"more important locations to deal with?\"\" was one particular quote, "

"Now of course, I will always defer to your limitless wisdom, but let me tell "
"you why I think this \"\"damn swamp\"\" is necessary to the future security "
"of the Empire.\n"
"\n"
"Black Marsh covers a huge portion of southeast Tamriel. From our exploration "
"of the coastline, the interior swampland is easily as large as Hammerfall or "
"Skyrim, and it contains an untapped reservoir of wealth and resources "
"waiting to be exploited. If the Lizard-Folk won't take advantage of that, "
"then certainly we should.\n"
"\n"
"And what about the Lizard-Folk themselves? Do we really want these primitive "
"savages governing themselves? That would leave our borders ripe for attack "
"if they ever gave rise to a charismatic leader of their own. Why wait for "
"the inevitable? Better to take matters into our own hands and chart our own "
"destiny. After all, that is the Imperial way!\n"

"\n"
"An Argonian \"\"forge\"\" is a strange place, let me tell you. I guess it's "
"more of a workshop than a forge. None of the familiar sounds or smells of my "
"forge back home greeted me when I entered the place: no ringing anvils, no "
"coal-smoke, no hissing quench troughs. They're just eerily quiet and packed "
"with chisels, axes, wooden buckets full of weird liquids, piles of rocks, "
"dead birds, live slugs … on and on it goes. \n"
"\n"
"For the first week or so, I felt very uneasy in Shukesh's workshop. She's "
"not exactly a big talker. The only sounds she made for the first few days "
"were sudden and irritated hisses when something didn't go exactly as she had "
"planned. She also sang a few old Jel folksongs, although I use the term "
"\"\"sang\"\" loosely. The first time I heard it, I thought she was murdering "
"one of those lizards crawling all over everything. The place is infested "
"with them!\n"
"\n"
"Eventually Shukesh started talking to me. At first, her comments were mostly "
"about my disgusting lack of scales or my round, beady eyes. Of course once "
"she started making fun of me, I knew we had become fast friends. One of the "
"first secrets Shukesh shared with me was the art of \"\"slug shaping.\"\" "
"Apparently Black Marsh is chock full of slugs. Back home we don't see a lot "
"of the slimy little creatures, but when we do, we tend to squash them and "
"then wipe them off our boots in disgust. Here in Lilmoth, however, "
"everything has a purpose. Most slugs aren't good for anything but eating. "
"(Or so I've heard. I won't eat anything that doesn't stand on four legs.) "
"But apparently some slugs have surprising applications. One of these special "
"slugs, called a \"\"jassa red,\"\" has an unusual defense mechanism. When "
"threatened, it squirts out an acidic mucous. I'm not sure what good that "
"does when something tries to eat it, but the acidic mucous is useful for "
"Argonian weaponsmiths. \n"
"\n"
"When Shukesh wants to incorporate a natural motif into her work, she places "
"the slugs onto the wood or stone and repeatedly flashes a piece of flint "
"directly behind them. Adjusting the position of the flint pushes the slugs "
"in different directions. As the slugs move across the wood or stone, they "
"leave behind a thin layer of acidic slime, creating long, smooth channels in "
"the material. The mucous interacts with different materials in different "
"ways. The reaction of the slime can even create natural pigments that range "
"from a muted umber to a phosphorescent yellow.\n"
"\n"
"Shukesh let me try my hand at it (on a piece of worthless broken lumber).  "
"Not surprisingly, I was all thumbs. I created a tangled mess of grooves—all "
"dyed a sickly, mottled green. When I threw the flint down in disgust, I "
"think Shukesh laughed at me. She insisted it was just a cough, and then told "
"me my slug shaping was utter \"\"rajpu.\"\" I didn't try to argue, as I "
"wasn't sure what rajpu was exactly, although I could hazard a good guess. "
"Anyway, I'll take a hammer and tongs over a slimy ball of burning snot any "
"day."

"\n"
"Another day in Lilmoth. The local weaponsmith, a wily old Argonian named "
"Shukesh, is a woman after my own heart. She's stoic, dedicated, and a little "
"ornery. I told her she must be half Orc. She gave me one of those forced "
"Argonian smiles that could either mean genuine amusement or total lack of "
"approval. It's damn near impossible for me to tell the difference. When I "
"first met her, she was working on a \"\"tusik\"\" sword, and I use the word "
"\"\"sword\"\" loosely. I honestly couldn't tell you what kind of weapon it "
"actually is. It's like a club and a sword had a pup, then kicked half its "
"teeth out and shaved down the others into fangs. I should probably be a "
"little more specific, eh?\n"
"\n"
"The Argonian smith starts with a length of wood—anywhere from the length of "
"her arm to the length of her tail. She spends a week or so shaving down the "
"wood until she achieves a paddle shape. (I saw a few works-in-progress and "
"mistook them for boat oars.) A lot of Argonians might be content to just "
"stain the wood and move on to the next step, but old Shukesh is a master. I "
"can tell you, what she lacks in personality, she makes up for in patience.  "
"She uses bones and fine-cut obsidian chisels to carve ornate patterns into "
"the face of the paddle. Most of these patterns form abstract animal "
"shapes—crocodiles and such. But a few of the patterns were kind of "
"disturbing. One tusik in particular set my skin to crawl. It appeared to be "
"a dark-stained skull with a series of ridges and spines. She said it was for "
"a \"\"special customer.\"\" I don't want to meet that customer, let me tell "
"you!\n"
"\n"
"Once the wood is cured, stained, and polished, Shukesh sets it aside and "
"begins to work on the next step in the task: stone-carving. According to "
"Shukesh, all kinds of stones are suitable for use in the process, but she "
"prefers to work with obsidian. Raw stones are chipped down into sharpened, "
"knife-blade shapes, from crude squares to evenly shaved fangs. Once these "
"\"\"teeth\"\" are hewn, she sets them into the paddle using wood or bone "
"pegs and boiled depassa gum. \n"
"\n"
"Depassa gum is a strange gunk, let me tell you. It smells like an echatare's "
"armpit, but adheres like a paste to wood and stone. Once it hardens, it's "
"damn near impossible to break, but it stays light and flexible like an "
"ironwood sapling. I told Shukesh that it reminded me of a mammoth gesso that "
"I sometimes use when fixing leather. She just gave me one of her "
"characteristic croaks and said, \"\"Easier to hunt a tree than a mammoth, "
"yes?\"\" It's hard to argue with that logic.\n"
"\n"
"Once the teeth are set in place, the smith wraps the handle in strips of "
"leather or bark, creating a grip that won't slip no matter how slick it gets "
"with rain or blood. Now the weapon is complete, without the use of any metal."
"  All told, it took her the better part of three weeks to finish the piece. \n"
"\n"
"The most remarkable thing about the tusik isn't even the weapon (which is "
"marvelous in its own right). It's all the skills that go with it. Shukesh "
"isn't just a smith, she's a woodcarver, an alchemist, a stonecutter, and a "
"weaver. Any one of those trades can take a lifetime to master and she "
"demonstrates proficiency in all four. Almost makes me ashamed. Maybe I "
"should take up woodcarving in my spare time. Ha! Like that'll happen. Can't "
"teach an old tusker new tricks, after all."

"I'm just an old Orc weaponsmith, and weapons are my life. When I was just a "
"nub-tusked whelp, I would sneak into the great forges of Orsinium to watch "
"the masters at work. In time I became an apprentice, dragging slag from one "
"end of the forge to the other. Then a journeyman, coated head to toe in soot "
"and sweat. Eventually, I took my place as one of the great forge masters. In "
"all my years of folding iron and hammering steel, I never once considered "
"the possibility that we could use something other than metal to craft our "
"weapons. Sure, we used mammoth leather and the like for binding and lacing. "
"Sometimes the silk-born dandies would demand an inlaid gem or two. But metal "
"was the heart of my craft. Imagine my surprise when I encountered the "
"weaponsmiths here in Lilmoth.\n"
"\n"
"I'd always meant to see the south of Tamriel eventually. Once the war broke "
"out, I figured, why not now? I could make a killing selling my wares to the "
"Covenant quartermasters, sure; but something about Black Marsh always piqued "
"my curiosity. \n"
"\n"
"I'd heard tales of these lizard-folk wielding wooden clubs and such in "
"battle. I imagined hissing savages with turtle-shell helmets and crude "
"leather greaves. I don't mind admitting that I was dead wrong. These "
"Argonians use methods and materials that I never could have imagined, and "
"the results are extraordinary. I've been taking notes, but I doubt they'll "
"do me any good. Half the materials are found only in Black Marsh, and after "
"decades of pounding metal, I doubt these old mitts would be worth a damn on "
"the finer details. Still, a smith who refuses to study isn't worth spit in a "
"snow-storm. So here I am. I thought I could teach these lizards a thing or "
"two, but it looks like I've got a lot to learn."

"\n"
"War is terrible. Don't let anyone tell you anything differently. It's like "
"standing in a storm-wracked lake, waiting for a dark fin to rise from the "
"depths to bite off an arm or a leg. We do a lot of waiting around, worrying "
"and watching for threats to appear from every direction. Then we rush out to "
"meet the enemy, fight wildly for a time, and then rush back to the relative "
"safety of our fortified positions. And then we do it again. And again. And "
"again!\n"
"\n"
"Today I fought alongside a large Nord female (at least, I think she was a "
"female; I still have a hard time with the whole dryskin gender thing) and a "
"Dark Elf battle-mage. I had never met either of them before, but we found "
"ourselves together after the confusion of a charge that involved at least "
"three different cohorts of Pact soldiers and an equal number of enemy "
"combatants. With no one else to turn to, and without uttering a single word, "
"we moved together and began to defend ourselves against the enemy forces.\n"
"\n"
"The three of us were outnumbered four to one. We had somehow found ourselves "
"in a rocky patch between two hills, with no immediate idea where the rest of "
"the Pact forces happened to be. We could hear the sounds of pitched battle "
"echoing from beyond the nearby hills, but there was no way to be certain who "
"was fighting or where. And we still had the matter of the enemy right before "
"us. I think they were Covenant Orcs, but I still have trouble "
"differentiating them from High Elves.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever the enemy was, they charged at us, testing our mettle and our "
"battle prowess. We held them back, time after time, taking down one or two "
"of them while suffering various cuts and bruises of our own. It might have "
"been ten minutes or ten hours. Time lost all meaning as we anchored "
"ourselves, shoulder to shoulder, to hold back the enemy waves.\n"
"\n"
"I never learned the name of the Dark Elf battle-mage, but I owe him my life. "
"We had whittled the enemy's numbers so that we were only contending with "
"twice as many as our small unit when one of their sorcerers hurled a ball of "
"fire toward me. I was engaged with two warriors—one wielding a sword, the "
"other a warhammer—and though I saw the bright flash from the corner of my "
"eye, I had no way to dodge out of the fire's path before it scorched me. "
"That's when the Dark Elf threw himself between me and the inferno, taking "
"the brunt of the blast so that I could finish dispatching the two warriors "
"before me. By the time I reached his side, he had succumbed to the intense "
"heat and flames.\n"
"\n"
"That left the Nord and I to finish dealing with the remaining enemy "
"combatants. Our first objective was to take down the sorcerer before she "
"could cast another devastating spell in our direction. The Nord handled this "
"by loosing the last of her arrows in the spellcaster's direction. At least "
"two of them hit their mark and buried themselves in the mage's chest. Now "
"there were three of them and two of us, and the remaining enemy appeared to "
"have lost both its confidence and its desire to continue fighting. They "
"turned to go. We decided not to give them that option.\n"
"\n"
"It took a little more time and wandering, but eventually we were each "
"reunited with our cohorts. I think it was that day that finally taught me "
"how important the alliance of our three races actually is.\n"

"like a haj mota stalking a mudcrab? I really do miss home!\n"
"\n"
"I'm writing from the Cold-Moon Inn in Windhelm, the capital city of Skyrim. "
"Yes, there's a lot of snow and it's brutally cold here. And yes, the Nords "
"are as big and as loud as all the stories you ever heard. But with all that, "
"this place has a beauty and a charm unlike anything that exists in our "
"beloved Black Marsh. You can still see signs of the Akaviri siege here and "
"there, and the palace of the Skald-King remains closed as repairs continue, "
"but the people are fierce and friendly in a way that we Saxhleel will never "
"be.\n"
"\n"
"You would have loved exploring the local Mages Guild guildhall. There were "
"mages from all over Tamriel in attendance, including a small Wood Elf who "
"performed amazing tricks for the visiting soldiers. She even pulled a golden "
"fish out of my ear! I don't know how she did that, but it certainly looked "
"delicious. (She seemed horrified when I mentioned that to her, by the way. "
"Strange, little Wood Elf.)\n"
"\n"
"One of my favorite places to visit was the long house that sheltered the "
"blacksmithing forges. It was so warm and comfortable in there! You couldn't "
"feel the cold, even though the structure was open at both ends, that's how "
"hot the fires burned.\n"
"\n"
"A great wall, anchored by nine towers, surrounds the city. I understand that "
"a portion of the wall was destroyed during the siege, but you can't see any "
"sign of that today. The nine towers represent the Nine Holds of Skyrim, "
"which shows that the Nords have almost as much reverence for symbols as we "
"do. I understand that they conduct great races along the top of the wall "
"during various festivals and celebrations, though there weren't any such "

"\n"

"\n"
"I was sent to serve with the Pact troops assigned to the Deshaan region of "
"Morrowind, and at the first opportunity I took leave to explore the fabled "
"city of the Dunmer. Like most of the Saxhleel that grew up in our village, I "

"devices on every corner, even though we are now friends and allies, but "
"nothing could be further from the truth.\n"
"\n"
"For the most part, the Dark Elves I encountered were hospitable if not "

"markets as well. I met Nords and Wood Elves, Imperials and Bretons, even a "
"Khajiit and High Elf during my visit. And the variety of goods available in "
"the market—it was almost more than I could comprehend!\n"
"\n"
"The Tribunal Temple was a sight to behold! It was huge and daunting, but "

"even met an Argonian who had adopted the worship of the Three as his own. "
"Talking to him was interesting, but I could never find it in my heart to "
"revere a being of flesh and blood, let alone a Dark Elf!\n"
"\n"
"I also had a chance to visit one of the famed Dark Elf cornerclubs. The "

"center of the main hall where intoxicated patrons took turns leaping in to "

"group of companions that included myself, Vos-Huruk, Tee-Wan, Xocin, the "
"Dark Elf twins Llensi and Meralyn, and the Nords Jod and Ulfbel, we departed "
"the war-torn countryside and returned to Mournhold for a final meeting with "
"Jorunn the Skald-King.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The more time I spend in this strange country, the more I miss the "
"mountains and the snow,\"\" Jorunn said as we entered his audience chamber "
"in the Dark Elf city. \"\"Now tell me, Black Fin,\"\" he said, turning to "
"face Keshu, \"\"are you sure you want to do this?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Keshu raised the spine of affirmation and said, \"\"I've done all I set out "
"to do for you and the Pact, Jorunn. It's time for me to return to Black "
"Marsh and do the same for my people.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Jorunn nodded solemnly. \"\"Then I can ask no more of you, my trusted "
"friend,\"\" he said with a tear in his eye. \"\"May Kyne guide you back "
"home, Black Fin. And if you ever need my aid, you have but to ask.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"At those words, Keshu's eyes sparkled like the stars in the sky. \"\"Well, "
"there is a small matter,\"\" she said, and then she went on to explain how "
"she was hoping to open Black Marsh to outsiders, especially crafters and "
"artisans, to help expand the knowledge and experiences of her people. \"\"I "
"shall put out the word,\"\" Jorunn agreed. \"\"And where should these "
"crafters and artisans go? To Stormhold?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"No,\"\" Keshu replied. \"\"Send them to Gideon.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Keshu, however, led us to Gideon, the Imperial stronghold in central Black "
"Marsh, where she was determined to establish a more inviting and vibrant "
"\"\"modern\"\" Argonian society. Her plan, as she explained them to us "
"during the journey, was to start out by bringing the things we learned and "
"discovered during our time in Morrowind and Skyrim to Gideon, and then begin "
"a series of quests to re-discover the secrets of the ancient Argonian "
"civilization. \"\"I do not want to change our culture,\"\" Keshu assured us. "
"\"\"I want to enhance it and bring back the glory we had and lost in ages "
"past.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"We may not have all agreed with everything Keshu outlined on our journey "
"home, but we believed in the Black Fin. We would follow her to Oblivion and "
"back if she asked it of us. So it wasn't that far a leap to realize that we "
"were going to help her achieve her dream for our people.\n"
"\n"
"As we approach the borders of Black Marsh, this ongoing narrative of how a "

"While I have learned a tremendous amount about individual tribes, I feel "
"that I'm still missing some crucial insights on inter-tribal relations. "
"There is a bizarre kind of fraternity here that contradicts almost "
"everything I've seen. Despite the violent raids, the dead-stealing, and the "
"poaching, the Argonians of different tribes still look upon one another as "
"egg-brothers and egg-sisters. For example, just the other day I saw a family "
"of Bright-Throats playing teeba-hatsei with a handful of Tum-Taleel raiders. "
"This was only a few hours after a violent clash claimed the life of one of "
"the Tum-Taleel. I've never seen the like. It's as though there's an enforced "
"forgetfulness, or a culture of exceptional forgiveness that defines all "
"inter-tribal relationships.\n"
"\n"
"At least some of this fraternal behavior must be rooted in their shared "
"racial narrative. The tribes of Black Marsh have had to set aside their "
"differences on countless occasions to repel invaders from Morrowind and "
"Cyrodiil. They also seem to understand how much they rely upon one "
"another—far better than most men or mer I've met. The Tum-Taleel recognize "
"that they need other tribes to create homes and goods for them to steal. The "
"Miredancers know that they need the Dead-Water tribe to defend their borders "
"and fend off the larger swamp predators. The Black-Tongues know that they "
"need the Hee-Tepsleel  to raise the crops they use in their alchemical brews."
" The Bright-Throats know that they need the Black-Tongues' Shadowscales to "
"enforce \"\"swamp law\"\" upon crooked outsiders who disrupt honest trade. "
"On and on it goes.\n"

"Religion also plays a role. I asked my friend, Eutei, how they could be so "

"\"\"We are all people of the root,\"\" he explained. \"\"A Black-Tongue may "

"According to the elders I spoke with, the Sap-Speaker is the Hist's direct "
"intermediary. (This is, of course, subject to debate. Many tribes boast "
"unique methods of communion with the Hist. But as far as I have seen, the "
"Miredancers make the most compelling case for the methods they use.) Sap-"
"Speakers often go into seclusion for days or even weeks on end, venturing "
"either down into the roots or high into the canopy of leaves in the "
"uppermost branches. Here, they commune with the Hist. Indeed, the word that "
"one of the elders used was \"\"journey.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"These journeys into the Hist tax the Sap-Speakers, and are thoroughly "
"private affairs. After days by themselves, the Sap-Speakers emerge to hide "
"away with old books, scrolls, and tablets. I asked after the purpose of "
"these periods of seclusion. As usual, the answers were light on details. "
"\"\"The Sap-Speaker enters the embrace of the Hist to learn from the great "
"tree,\"\" one elder said. \"\"While in close contact with the roots and "
"branches, the Sap-Speaker receives visions and other forms of communication "
"that neither you nor I would understand.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The other elder continued. \"\"Even the Sap-Speaker finds some of what is "
"shown to be mystifying and confusing. I have heard that a Sap-Speaker is "
"treated to ancient metaphors, arcane secrets, and visions that make little "
"sense to creatures so far removed from sap and pulp.\"\" Apparently, the "
"second period of seclusion allows the Sap-Speaker time to reflect on what he "
"or she was shown, as well as time to consult with the ancient writings of "
"Sap-Speakers who came before. After a suitable period of study and "
"reflection, the Sap-Speaker emerges to reveal the Hist's will to the tribes. "
"\n"
"\n"
"I attempted to get more information about what happens while the Sap-Speaker "
"meditates among the roots or branches, but I'm not sure the elders knew much "
"more. They did tell me that the only nourishment the Sap-Speaker receives "
"during these periods of seclusion is provided by the Hist itself in the form "
"of sap, leaves, and the otherwise forbidden fruit of the tree.\n"
"\n"
"There is a price to pay for the gift of Hist communion, however. Ingesting "
"large quantities of Hist sap is a dangerous affair, even for Argonians. Sap-"
"Speakers routinely suffer the effects of sap-poisoning, including \"\"gold "
"tongue\"\" (permanent change of mouth pigmentation to a golden hue), "
"unbidden hallucinations, \"\"bark-scale\"\" (thickening and darkening of "
"surface scales), and other maladies they were reticent to talk about. The "
"current Sap-Speaker, Thumarz, was in seclusion during my visit to the tribal "
"village. I hope to meet him someday. If he's half as wise as the elders I "
"interacted with, I'd no doubt learn a great deal from him.\n"
"\n"
"Despite their deeply religious nature, the Miredancers also seem to have an "
"obsession with games of all types. They are particularly fond of the games "
"Nine-Shells and Shells and Stones, as well as sports such as the popular "
"\"\"teeba-hatsei\"\" (also known as \"\"hip and tail ball.\"\") In addition "
"to lovingly explaining their own games, they wanted to know everything I "
"could tell them about the games we play back in Wayrest. I must admit, their "
"enthusiasm was quite infectious! And I found it highly amusing to watch them "
"try to re-create Deceiver's Bones from the vague description I provided.\n"
"\n"
"The Miredancers are also inveterate gamblers, but they often forget to "
"collect their winnings. Unlike the games of men and mer, Miredancer "
"competitions appear completely devoid of malice or injured pride. Victory "
"and defeat seem more like afterthoughts than objectives, due in no small "
"part to their phlegmatic disposition. As in most things, they focus strictly "
"on the moment—the now. It pains me to leave their village, but I still have "
"many more tribes to study. I doubt any of them will be as fascinating or as "
"friendly as the Miredancers."

"\n"
"We had another close call today. Despite strenuous protests from our native "
"guide, the expedition elected to cross the Keel-Sakka River by bridge. One "
"of our guides (a bright-scaled Argonian named Reelus) urged us to ford the "
"river farther downstream and avoid the bridge. (For the record, I argued in "
"favor of this plan, as Reelus has never steered us wrong.) But there are "
"many scholars in our group who are unaccustomed to hard work and hostile "
"environments. We very nearly paid for their comfort with our lives.\n"
"\n"
"It turns out that the bridge is \"\"owned\"\" by a tribe called the \"\"Tum-"
"Taleel,\"\" or the \"\"Root-House People\"\" in the common tongue. They are "
"a belligerent and warlike people—quick to anger and known throughout the "
"swamp for their brutality and quick tempers. They make a practice of "
"attacking peaceful villages and killing or driving off the inhabitants. Then "
"they settle into the newly-vacant huts and exhaust all of the village's "
"resources. Other Saxhleel often compare them to \"\"burglar "
"crabs\"\"—creatures that eat snails and smaller crabs, and afterward move "
"into the empty shells. \n"
"\n"
"Several members of the tribe appeared in front of our caravan as soon as we "
"stepped onto the bridge. I knew we were in danger as soon as I saw them: the "
"Tum-Taleel are significantly larger than other Argonians I've encountered, "
"with broad shoulders, narrow eyes, and wide, powerful jaws. They wore "
"nothing but loincloths and war-paint, and they wielded huge wooden clubs "
"bedecked with feathers and splattered with dry blood.\n"
"\n"
"Reelus quickly stepped to the front of the caravan and began speaking in "
"urgent croaks and hisses. I have no idea what she was saying, but the Tum-"
"Taleel seemed to consider her words for a moment. The leader pointed at us "
"and growled something in a low, rumbling voice. Reelus seemed disturbed by "
"this and turned to face us.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"He wants the horses,\"\" she said. \n"
"\n"
"It was very clear that we had no choice but to acquiesce. We cut the horses "
"free of their tethers, four in all. The Root-House People took three of the "
"horses, and led them off the road and into the swamp. The leader of the "
"brigands led the fourth horse to the middle of the bridge, stepped back a "
"few paces, and then brought down his club on the animal's skull with a "
"sickening thud. The poor beast's head was pulped. I've never seen anything "
"so ghastly! One of my compatriots retched over the side of the cart. Reelus "
"wasted no time gathering the strongest of our party to push the carts to the "
"end of the bridge. Luckily, the next village is only a half-day's push away. "
"I think everyone will heed Reelus from now on."

"Today we came across an unusual sight, a mound of empty flasks set against "
"the base of a phossa tree. Our guide explained, \"\"The Black-Tongues have "
"tapped this tree.\"\" He then went on to explain that the \"\"Kota-"
"Vimleel,\"\" or the \"\"Black-Tongues,\"\" is another one of the many tribes "
"of Argonians living in the Murkmire region of Black Marsh. Unlike the "
"belligerent Tum-Tahleel or the eerie Veeskhleel, the Black Tongues tend to "
"be polite and soft-spoken—under the right circumstances. If caught off-"
"guard, however, they react with reflexive violence, and have been known to "
"kill those trespassing upon their territory without hesitation or mercy. "
"Accomplished alchemists, they often leave flasks and other alchemical tools "
"out in the open as a warning to outsiders marking their territory. \n"
"\n"
"The Black-Tongues are ardent Sithis worshipers. As such, they dedicate "
"almost all their resources to producing as many Shadowscales as possible. "
"What is a Shadowscale, you ask? I wish I knew. Most locals simply refuse to "
"discuss the subject with outsiders. Argonian commoners revere them with what "
"appears to be a combination of awe and terror, and even mentioning the name "
"out loud seems to be a cultural taboo. A few of the less-superstitious "
"Argonians I've met did share a few facts. \n"
"\n"
"Apparently, the Shadowscales are members of a bizarre monastic order of "
"highly trained assassins. Any Argonian born under the sign of the Shadow is "
"given to the order and raised as one of these mysterious murderers. I was "
"aghast. \"\"Surely it's just the hostile tribes that follow this barbaric "
"practice?\"\" I asked. But no. This appears to be a completely ubiquitous "
"practice. Even the amiable Bright-Throats and wise Miredancers participate "
"in this tradition.\n"
"\n"
"The Black-Tongues take the obligation very seriously, however. They use "
"their encyclopedic knowledge of swamp vegetation and wildlife to craft a "
"powerful contraceptive called \"\"Gloom Nectar.\"\" Drinking the potion "
"allows the tribe to synchronize their egg-laying cycle, thus guaranteeing a "
"huge crop of new Argonians born under the Shadow sign every year.  \n"
"\n"
"Their alchemical prowess serves the Shadow-born well in their future "
"professions as assassins. Black-Tongues are known to craft some of the "
"deadliest potions in all of Tamriel. Even the Gloom Nectar will kill, if "
"ingested by non-Argonians—just more proof that almost anything found in "
"Black Marsh will kill you under the right circumstances.\n"
"\n"
"While I would love to meet one of the Kota-Vimleel in person and find out "
"more about their alchemical skills and their ties to the mysterious "
"Shadowscales, lingering in their territory without an invitation is not a "
"wise practice. I'd just as soon not have Viper's Bite slipped into my "
"morning tea."

"I write these words by candlelight. My entourage was on its way to Stormhold "
"when our guide suddenly ordered us to stop. He sniffed the air and wrinkled "
"his nose, declaring that we'd strayed too close to \"\"Veeskhleel-Tzel,\"\" "
"as if that explained everything. We heeded him, but I pressed for more of an "
"explanation as we corrected our course. Our guide was reluctant to speak "
"more on the subject, but after a great deal of convincing, at the cost of "
"many more of my possessions than I would have hoped, I finally got an answer."
"\n"
"\n"
"The \"\"Ghost People\"\" are a tribe native to Murkmire, and they appear to "
"have a rather horrid reputation, as far as I can tell. He only spoke of them "
"in hushed tones, after glancing into the shadows. He claimed that the Ghost "
"People live entirely in the dark, only leaving the Deepmire to stalk the "
"night and abduct the unwary. Though he'd never seen one in the flesh, he "
"claimed that they are so pale you can see down to their bones. If you've "
"ever imagined what keeps Argonian children up at night, picture that and "
"you'll have a pretty good idea. As unwelcoming as they sound, I'll admit "
"that I wanted to know more about this unusual tribe. Much as I might want to "
"go directly to the source, I opted to limit my inquiries to other locals who "
"were willing to speak on the Veeskhleel.\n"
"\n"
"What I learned was that the Ghost People are shrouded in mystery, even among "
"the locals, and the rumors surrounding them are abundant. Of all the wild "
"stories I hear about the Veeskhleel, two things seem certain. You can spot "
"them by their pale, white scales, and they have a sour reputation as "
"\"\"dead stealers\"\" and kidnappers. The distaste for grave robbing is "
"something I could certainly understand but given how little attachment "
"Argonians in Murkmire place on permanence I was surprised that it was taboo "
"to them as well. When I asked my guide about this, he told me that it isn't "
"just the bodies that the Ghost People steal. It's believed that they bury "
"the corpses among the roots of their Hist and perform profane rituals to "
"steal the departed souls from their tribes. To them, there are few greater "
"taboos.\n"
"\n"
"As I sit here pondering dreadful necromancy in the dark, I can't help but "
"imagine luckless travelers rising out of the shallow water by the dozen, "
"covered in mud swollen with rot as my lone candle gutters out. We should be "
"setting out at first light. It can't come soon enough to chase away this "
"black night and the pallid Ghost People."

"\n"
"A few months ago, I asked a Miredancer elder how many tribes resided in the "
"swamps of Black Marsh. He sat quietly for a long time (as Argonians often "
"do) then pointed behind me. I looked back to see hundreds of torchbugs "
"flitting between the cypress trees, piercing the gloom with flares of green "
"and yellow light. \"\"As many as the lights,\"\" he said.\n"
"\n"
"I could scarcely believe such a claim. Argonians are prone to hyperbole, so "
"I dismissed the elder's proclamation as exaggeration. After spending more "
"time among the natives, however, I'm starting to believe that the elder's "
"count might be closer to accurate than I originally estimated. I have "
"discovered at least twelve distinct tribal groups in Murkmire alone, and I'm "
"convinced that scores more exist. Many of the local tribes are hostile, so "
"direct contact with them is next to impossible. But I've seen far too much "
"evidence of their existence to write them off as myth or legend. These "
"journals will serve as a record of my discoveries as I explore the wilds of "
"Murkmire. I shall begin with the tribe most outsiders meet first.\n"
"\n"
"Most outsiders who spend any time in Lilmoth will likely interact with "
"several of the coastal tribes. The most noteworthy, however, are the "
"\"\"Wasseek-haleel,\"\" or \"\"Bright-Throats.\"\" By and large, the tribe "
"is composed of cheerful artisans who have enjoyed a fruitful relationship "
"with both outsiders and deep-swamp Argonians. The Bright-Throats are famous "
"for their rich music and dance tradition, as well as their preternatural "
"talent as merchants, diplomats, and woodcarvers. While they make countless "
"items, including musical instruments, kitchenware, armor, and weapons, they "
"are most respected for their \"\"xeech'kis,\"\" or \"\"seed dolls.\"\" These "
"figurines vary in size—sometimes as large as an Orc's fist, sometimes as "
"small as a single grain of rice. They almost always depict local animals, "
"but they also carve the seed dolls to resemble eggs or tiny Argonians. \n"
"\n"
"Seed dolls are highly sought after—both as protective talismans and works of "
"native art. Cheap imitations are regularly produced by rival tribes, but a "
"genuine xeech-ki is easy to identify after handling the genuine article. I "
"have purchased several in my time here. My favorite is a small turtle with "
"amber inlays. The carver told me that the turtle is a powerful but unruly "
"totem. I never thought of turtles as particularly unruly, but the locals "
"would know, I suppose. I plan to purchase several more before returning to "
"Bangkorai and eventually to my home in Wayrest."

"By Mee-See, Squire and Personal Aide to Keshu the Black Fin\n"
"\n"
"In the midst of General Keshu's continued build-up and improvement of the "
"Ebonheart Pact's allied forces, the Black Fin received a summons from Jorunn "
"the Skald-King. We had been training with combined troops near Riften when "
"the runner arrived with the sealed letter. The meeting would take place at "
"Fort Amol, in Eastmarch, in two-day's time. Keshu began to make preparations "
"to depart at once.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu the Black Fin decided to travel light and fast, taking only a small "
"contingent with her to meet with the Skald-King. I accompanied the General, "
"of course, along with Tee-Wan, Xocin, and the Nord warrior, Kora Greatstorm. "
"Vos-Huruk remained behind to command the troops and continue the training "
"exercises. As our small group approached Fort Amol, we were met a good "
"distance outside the settlement and led in through a hidden trail that "
"bypassed the main roads into and out of the town. We were hurriedly escorted "
"to the jarl's manor and taken to a secret meeting room within the large "
"estate. There, standing behind a large table, was Jorunn the Skald-King.\n"
"\n"
"I sensed immediately that something was very different from our previous "
"meetings with Jorunn. For one thing, he didn't rush to scoop up Keshu in a "
"tremendous hug, and he wasn't his usual loud and boisterous self. To be "
"fair, the weight of the crown had taken a toll on the bard-turned-ruler, but "
"he appeared more grave and serious than I had ever seen him. \"\"The "
"Tribunal has sent a dire warning, Black Fin,\"\" Jorunn began. \"\"Almalexia "
"has had a vision. Or maybe it was Vivec? Who can say? In any case, they warn "
"that a threat to the Ebonheart Pact is developing and we need to be ready. "
"So, everything you've been doing? Now you must triple your efforts and "
"prepare us for war.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The new war effort was placed in the hands of three generals, one from each "
"member nation of the Pact. Keshu represented the Argonians, Kora Greatstorm "
"represented the Nords, and Yeveth Noramil represented the Dark Elves. These "
"were the generals that would, together, bolster and prepare the Pact's "
"offensive and defensive capabilities for the coming years. And, thanks to "
"the preparations that the Black Fin had already begun, the foundation was in "
"place for the arms buildup to reach the next level in a relatively short "
"amount of time. Before we departed that secret room in the jarl's manor, "
"Jorunn had one last nugget of wisdom to pass on to Keshu. \"\"Peace is a "
"fragile, precious thing, Black Fin,\"\" the Skald-King said in a weary voice."
" \"\"Cherish the time you have with it, for it never lasts long.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Over the next two years, the expanding Pact army faced a number of small "
"tests, including skirmishes with Imperial legions and Daggerfall troops, and "
"it acquitted itself admirably. In many ways, these small encounters led to "
"the War of the Three Banners. When the three separate alliances finally "
"declared war against each other, Keshu led the Pact army into the field. The "
"land of Cyrodiil became the battlefield, and the sound of war echoed "
"throughout the land.\n"
"\n"
"For the better part of a year, General Keshu and the Pact army gained "
"ground, lost ground, and gained it back again. We couldn't claim victory, as "
"the war continued, but we won many significant battles—much to the chagrin "
"of the Covenant and the Dominion. Then, at the height of her power and "
"popularity, the Black Fin made a decision that surprised us all. \"\"We've "
"done all we can for the Pact,\"\" Keshu explained. \"\"It's time for us to "
"go home.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And that was how the Black Fin's foreign adventures came to an abrupt end."

"By Mee-See, Squire and Personal Aide to Keshu the Black Fin\n"
"\n"
"It was well into the second year after the formation of the Ebonheart Pact, "
"and Keshu and the Black Fin Legion (minus the troops we left behind as part "
"of the Pact army in Morrowind) were now touring the Nords' lands of Skyrim. "
"Our first stop after crossing into Nord territory was the town of Riften, "
"where we were treated to a typical Nord celebration that included lots of "
"food, lots of mead, and a number of good-natured brawls that seem to be a "
"common pastime in the colder climes. While there, we helped fortify some of "
"the town's defenses, which Keshu insisted we do wherever we went to show our "
"willingness to provide whatever assistance we could during our visits.\n"
"\n"
"After more than a week in Riften, we began our trek north through Eastmarch "
"toward the city of Windhelm for Keshu's reunion with Jorunn—who was now "
"Jorunn the Skald-King, if you can believe that! Apparently, the big Nord was "
"a prince or some such, and was now the leader of the entire Nord nation! And "
"Windhelm, what a city! It was as large and as impressive in its own way as "
"Mournhold, but where the Dark Elf metropolis was a reflection of its people, "
"Windhelm was clearly and undeniably a reflection of the Nords. Repairs were "
"still underway to deal with the damage inflicted by the Akaviri siege, but "
"that did nothing to detract from the sheer grandeur of the Nord city.\n"
"\n"
"Jorunn met us at the gates, grabbed Keshu up in an enormous hug, and then "
"invited us all to enjoy the hospitality of his home and city. The "
"celebration lasted for a week and a day! The Nords certainly love to throw a "
"good party, and they seem to look for any excuse to have one. During the "
"celebration, we were treated to the best mead and ale the Nords produced, "
"exquisite delicacies such as rabbit meatballs, and some of the most ribald "
"drinking songs I had ever heard—all sung extremely loudly and with a lot of "
"clinking of mugs and goblets.\n"
"\n"
"When the mead casks were finally empty and the rabbit meatballs had run out, "
"the celebration came to an abrupt end. Then the work began. We stayed in "
"Windhelm for the better part of a month, helping repair the outer walls of "
"the city and providing whatever other aid the Nords were comfortable "
"allowing us to assist with. And whenever they could both spare the time, "
"Keshu and the Skald-King huddled in a corner and spoke at length about a "
"variety of topics. No one was allowed to join them during these discussions, "
"but I always got the sense that they were sharing their thoughts on "
"leadership, the alliance, and the future of our nations.\n"
"\n"
"The Black Fin Legion, as we had come to know it, came to an end in Skyrim, "
"as well. Our soldiers were divided into small teams and sent to serve with "
"Pact troops of mixed nationality, fighting alongside Nords and Dark Elves in "
"the same cohorts. I stayed with Keshu, of course, and I was there when the "
"Skald-King offered her a unique honor. \"\"I want you to command the Pact "
"forces in Skyrim, Black Fin,\"\" Jorunn proclaimed. \"\"Will you accept this "
"charge?\"\" To no one's surprise, Keshu agreed. And through her efforts over "
"the next seven years, the tactics and strategies of the Pact's military "
"might were developed and set in place.\n"
"\n"
"Which is why the Pact was prepared when the War of the Three Banners began."

"\n"
"Now, the declaration of the formation of the Ebonheart Pact and the "
"abolition of Argonian slavery didn't result in the immediate cessation of "
"all Dark Elf slaver activity. It would take almost a full year for most of "
"the Dark Elf provinces and holdings to comply with the order of the "
"Tribunal, and even then there were Dark Elf Houses that refused to accept "
"the new accords. This resulted in a few awkward situations for Keshu and her "
"Black Fin Legion as it toured the land of Morrowind as the initial Argonian "
"representatives to the alliance.\n"
"\n"
"We met with a good amount of fear and hatred during those early days of the "
"alliance. Some Dark Elves became very uncomfortable when a heavily armed "
"force of Argonians approached their town or village. At these, we were "
"turned away at best or attacked by settlements with sizable militias. "
"Others, though, having heard the story of the Battle of Ebonheart, appeared "
"grateful for our help and were happy to welcome us into their homes. While "
"such treatment is much more common now, back then it was nearly unheard of, "
"and we were both surprised and thankful for every friendly face we "
"encountered.\n"
"\n"
"We spent that first year of the alliance in Dark Elf territory, making our "
"presence known and working to make sure that all of the tenets of the "
"agreement were adhered to. We also took in many of the newly freed "
"Argonians, giving the ones who decided not to return to Black Marsh or try "
"to make a go of it as free Saxhleel in Morrowind an immediate purpose and a "
"place to belong. In this way, the Black Legion continued to grow even as it "
"traveled throughout Morrowind.\n"
"\n"
"Eventually, we arrived at Mournhold as guests of the Tribunal. We spent "
"nearly a month camped outside the city and regularly met with Almalexia and "
"other important Dark Elf and Nord officials. Keshu participated in "
"discussions to bolster the defense of the Pact by forming an \"\"army of the "
"alliance,\"\" which would include forces donated by each of the member "
"nations. As we were looking for a purpose, Keshu volunteered the Black Fin "
"Legion to serve as the backbone of the new allied army. In time, Keshu would "
"become not only a war hero, but one of the foremost generals leading Pact "
"forces. \n"
"\n"
"Before that initial year had ended, Keshu and the Black Legion would prove "
"their worth to the Pact by once again saving the day. This time, it was to "
"deal with raiders crossing the mountains from the west. Rumors abounded that "
"the raiders were either funded by the Daggerfall Covenant or were Covenant "
"soldiers in disguise, but we were never able to prove that. When reports of "
"a large band of raiders attacking Dark Elf settlements in western Morrowind "
"reached Mournhold, Keshu offered to take the Pact army on a hunting "
"expedition.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu's force consisted of mostly Black Fin legionnaires, bolstered by a "
"contingent of Nord soldiers and a squadron of Dark Elf mages and healers. We "
"moved quickly, following the path of destruction left by the raiders until "
"we finally caught them at Indrano Pass. Keshu divided our forces, sending "
"half of our contingent around to cut off the raiders' escape path into the "
"mountains, while the rest of our troops formed an arrowhead and advanced on "
"the raiders' position. Instead of holding fast, the raiders decided to turn "
"and run. That's when our troops swarmed out of the rocky foothills and we "
"caught the raiders between us. After all the trouble they caused, we "
"expected them to put up more of a fight."

"necessarily carry the responsibilities and obligations that such a position "
"among the Nords or Dark Elves does. Later, as Keshu began to adopt some of "
"the customs of our allies, I was named as squire to the Black Fin. When Peek-"
"Ereel decided to leave the legion, I also inherited the duty of recording "
"significant events as they happened in the life of the mighty Keshu. Now, "
"understand, this wasn't a specific duty related to my role as ka. This was "
"an obligation passed on to me by Peek-Ereel herself without the express "
"knowledge of Keshu, and it was an obligation I readily accepted.\n"
"\n"
"So, where to begin? I think I'll start with the day the alliance began to "
"take shape. The three nations (well, I find it difficult to actually refer "
"to our people as a nation, but the reference makes the Nords and Dark Elves "
"more comfortable, so there you have it) had met on the field of battle and "
"come together to finally defeat the Akaviri invaders. After the Akaviri "
"finished sacking Windhelm, it turned its attention to the south and east and "
"began to march against Morrowind. As the Akaviri invasion force cut a path "
"toward Mournhold, the Dark Elf army—led by Almalexia of the "
"Tribunal—established a defensive line to halt their progress. Jorunn and the "
"Nords, meanwhile, rallied their own forces and followed after the Akaviri, "
"catching them from behind. The Akaviri, caught between two powerful armies, "
"nevertheless was able to withstand the two-pronged attack. They may even "
"have been able to eventually win the day, but that might just be speculation "
"on my part. In any case, they never had the chance to try.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu's force, a phalanx of Saxhleel shellbacks and swamp warriors, hit the "
"Akaviri from the south, providing the last element needed to end this period "
"of invasion. Our troops, seasoned from fighting the Dark Elf slavers in "
"Black Marsh, were the final ingredient required to overwhelm the invaders, "
"and we fell upon them with wild abandon. Keshu wanted to help her friend "
"Jorunn, but she also had an ulterior motive for marching our legion out of "
"the swamp and into the heart of Morrowind. She wanted the other nations to "
"recognize the value and veracity of the Saxhleel—the Argonians. We were more "
"than primitive savages. We were more than slaves. We were the equals of the "
"others, and we were here to save them from alien invaders.\n"
"\n"
"I won't say that the victory was totally due to the intervention of Keshu's "
"legion, but we certainly played our part. We fought valiantly alongside the "
"ferocious Nords and the cunning Dark Elves, slaughtering Akaviri soldiers "
"with every step of our advance. When the fighting finally ended near the "
"city of Ebonheart and victory was ours, Keshu hurried to meet with the "
"leaders of the other two factions. I, as her loyal squire, followed in her "
"wake.\n"
"\n"
"I had never been in the presence of so many powerful and important people "
"before! I had heard stories about Jorunn the Nord Bard, but I never imagined "
"he was really that big! And Almalexia—who the Dark Elves worshiped as a "
"god—was cold and beautiful, for a scaleless Elf without a tail. Jorunn "
"stepped forward and greeted Keshu like an old friend. \"\"We owe you a great "
"debt, Black Fin,\"\" Jorunn said in his loud, booming voice. \"\"What can "
"the Nords and the Dark Elves offer you for your invaluable assistance this "
"day?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Keshu was silent for a few long moments, looking intently at Jorunn first, "
"and then turning her attention to Almalexia. With her eyes locked upon the "
"Mother of Morrowind, she finally replied, \"\"No more Argonian slaves. Set "
"my people free.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Almalexia and Jorunn exchanged a look of their own, and the large Nord's "
"gaze never wavered. After a time, the Dark Elf leader made a slight nod of "
"her head and said, \"\"A reasonable request. And one the Dark Elves shall "
"honor—with one provision. The Argonians must join the Dark Elves and the "
"Nords in a mutual pact of cooperation and defense. In that way, all three of "
"our nations will remain free.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Thus began a series of negotiations that lasted well into the next day and "
"ended with the formation of the Ebonheart Pact. Keshu agreed to keep her "
"forces in the north to help bolster the defense of her new allies, but not "
"before she sent runners to Stormhold to inform our people of the news: "
"slavery was abolished and the Argonians were now allied with the Nords and "
"the Dark Elves. Since we had no government, at least not in the sense that "
"our new allies did, Keshu determined to remain in Nord and Dark Elf "
"territory to solidify the Saxhleel position and make sure the various "
"agreements were adhered to. In the meantime, she sent Xocin back to Black "
"Marsh to find ambassadors to serve in the capital cities of the alliance.\n"
"\n"
"And that was how the Argonians joined the Ebonheart Pact."

"Darling Helga,\n"
"\n"
"You'll never believe what I saw the other day. I was walking through Lilmoth "
"and came upon a small group of Argonian musicians. Most were playing clay "
"flutes and lizard-hide drums, but one was playing the craziest instrument "
"I've ever seen. He called it a \"\"vossa-satl.\"\" Apparently, there are all "
"kinds of vossa-satls—some as small as a jaw harp and some as big as a pipe "
"organ! My new friend's vossa-satl was about the size of a game hen. Sounded "
"a bit like a game hen, too.\n"
"\n"
"The instrument looks kind of like a polished wooden clam shell with a series "
"of valves along the top. Each segment of the shell is actually a small, "
"hollow compartment with a mouth like a bugle (the one I saw had five). "
"According to the musician, each chamber is a different size and produces a "
"different tone.\n"
"\n"
"Now here's the craziest part: they put live frogs inside! My friend was kind "
"enough to open his vossa-satl to show me the five small frogs within, one in "
"each chamber! He gushed over them like a new mother showing off her babies. "
"He told me their names, what they did for fun, and what they liked to eat. "
"The only thing he didn't tell me is where he found them. Apparently, the "
"location of their spawning pond is a tightly guarded secret.\n"
"\n"
"Before every performance, he squirts a few drops of frog-musk into each "
"compartment. This drives the frogs wild and sets them chirping and croaking "
"like mad. By pushing the valves, he's able to muffle certain chambers while "
"leaving others open. This allows for some bizarre but harmonious notes! I "
"could scarcely believe it! I offered to buy his instrument on the spot, but "
"he refused. Just as well, I suppose. I doubt those frogs would survive a "
"winter in Windhelm. I ended up buying you a flute instead. Not the most "
"exciting instrument, but I'm sure it'll sound better than that old goat-horn "
"bugle you love to play! \n"

"Studying Saxhleel Concepts by Teldenrinde of the Mages Guild\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The haj mota has an old spirit. Even in the egg, she is old and wise. "
"You, too, must become old if you wish to hunt her.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"This is a common theme in Argonian culture and folklore, the idea of aging "
"backward or aging prematurely. It can be a confusing concept for outsiders "
"to fully grasp. This isn't surprising. For men and mer, the experience of "
"life happens somewhere between the past and the future.  For Argonians, time "
"is much more fluid.\n"
"\n"
"This makes the existence and primacy of the Jekka-Wass cultural calendar all "
"the more confusing. Wasseek Saxhleel and many of their regional neighbors "
"place great emphasis on the passage of months and the circular, recurring "
"nature of the Tamrielic year. Some scholars contend that the calendar is "
"just a holdover from the ancient days of the great Argonian stone sculptures."
" According to the theory, the calendar is a vestigial tail that's lasted "
"through tradition even though it's totally inconsistent with present-day "
"Saxhleel values. I'm not so sure.\n"
"\n"
"I recently asked a Jekka-Wass elder how they can see time as fluid and murky "
"while maintaining an elaborate and surprisingly accurate calendar. He sat "
"quietly for what seemed like an eternity. Eventually he spoke:\n"
"\n"
"\"\"[The calendar] is like a bowl of water. The day and the night swim in "
"the bowl.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I could tell that he wasn't very happy with this answer, but he was resigned "
"to it. His frustration was rooted in both his limited grasp of Cyrodilic and "
"the shortcomings of his native tongue. You see, as far as I can tell, Jel "
"has no tenses; at least nothing that we'd recognize as a tense. The closest "
"substitution I've heard interpreters use is \"\"old\"\" and \"\"new.\"\" "
"They talk a great deal about \"\"changing\"\" and \"\"becoming\"\"—words "
"that imply forward motion. But again, these words are obfuscated by all "
"manner of arcane terms and concepts that even I can't decipher.\n"
"\n"
"I will do my best to understand—but I doubt the murky water will ever become "

"\n"
"Historians often refer to the Blackwater War as a single conflict that "
"spanned twenty-six years. While the primary combatants were essentially the "
"same, the first, second, and third campaigns had almost nothing in common "
"with one another. By the year 1E 2833, the Imperial strategy had been so "
"heavily revised that it was barely recognizable as Imperial. While "
"\"\"Sardecus' Reforms\"\" had reorganized the Legion, the \"\"Falco "
"Doctrine\"\" was the true catalyst that drove the war's endgame. \n"
"\n"
"General Lucinia Falco took command of the Legion shortly after Sardecus' "
"passing. She was the natural choice: a close confidant of Sardecus; strong, "
"fiercely loyal to the Empire; and utterly ruthless. She received her "
"officer's commission shortly after the Battle of Argonia, which meant that "
"her entire military career had been shaped by the Blackwater War. Unlike her "
"predecessors, she knew that the battle could not be won on a single front. "
"She urged the Empire to offer letters of marque and temporary commissions to "
"the countless pirates off the coast of Lilmoth and Archon. Working in "
"conjunction with a legion of Diamond Marines, this force succeeded in taking "
"vast swaths of territory in the southeastern marshes and even parts of the "
"interior swamp. \n"
"\n"
"Using Gideon as her base of operations, Falco launched the second prong in "
"the region-wide attack. Rather than sending out a full legion as her "
"predecessors had done, she broke her force into hundreds of compact, highly "
"lethal units. These expeditionary platoons (later referred to as "
"\"\"redbelts\"\") were led by grizzled swamp veterans—some of which had been "
"serving since the inception of the second campaign. \n"
"\n"
"The redbelts met with a great deal of success early on, claiming most of "
"western Black Marsh before finally grinding to a halt outside the thick bogs "
"and eerie silence of the region's core. Unfortunately, given each unit's "
"size, they could not hold what they took for long. What began as a battle of "
"two nations became a protracted and complex guerrilla war, replete with all "
"the horrors associated with such a conflict. 1E 2834 to 2836 was a dark time "
"for both sides. The Argonians and the Imperials each conducted campaigns of "
"intimidation and terror.\n"
"\n"
"Rather than an official armistice, the war seemed to simply end in late 1E "
"2836. Argonians who had been fighting Imperials for decades abruptly buried "
"their weapons and went back to farming, fishing, and weaving without "
"rendering a formal surrender. The Empire wasted no time in officially "
"claiming the region in 1E 2837. At long last, the Blackwater War came to a "
"sudden and inexplicable end. \n"
"\n"
"The Argonians' abrupt cessation of hostilities is just another in a long "
"series of mysteries associated with this conflict. The prevailing assumption "
"is that their bizarre tree-worshiping tradition had something to do with it, "
"but we may never know why they actually laid down their weapons. As a "
"historian, it's a vexing situation, but mysteries born in the deep murk of "
"Black Marsh are seldom solved. At least, they are seldom solved to a "
"satisfying conclusion."

"\n"
"Sardecus' command strategy hinged on one fundamental principle—the swamp was "
"the true enemy, not the Argonians. Disease accounted for roughly half of all "
"fatalities in the first campaign, followed closely by mysterious "
"disappearances. By his estimation, Argonian raids stood at a distant third. "
"With these facts in mind, he created a new war doctrine and disseminated it "
"to all of his officers. The crux of the strategy was simple: the only way to "
"conquer Black Marsh was to destroy it. \n"
"\n"
"Sardecus deployed entire cohorts of engineers and sappers to the front lines."
" While legionnaires launched punishing raids on border villages, the "
"supporting troops drained swamps, salted rice paddies, and felled hundreds "
"of trees.  The most well-known event of this portion of the war was the "
"\"\"Great Burn\"\" of 1E 2828. \n"
"\n"
"Records indicate that in early Rain's Hand 1E 2828, Elissia Mallicius (one "
"of Sardecus' most-trusted legates) ordered a unit of sappers to set fire to "
"a peat bog outside of Stormhold. The sappers did as they were told, not "
"knowing that the bog was just one part of a massive underground network. "
"Months passed before legionnaires started reporting random fires as far away "
"as Soulrest and Gideon. It took several more months before the Legion "
"realized that the entire region was on fire. \n"
"\n"
"An inferno of burning peat and detritus raged underfoot for more than three "
"years. The already deadly Marsh became so dangerous that the Legion was "
"forced to give ground for the first time in the better part of a decade. "
"Choking fumes and thundering eruptions of burning swamp gas made the area "
"nearly uninhabitable, even for Argonians. Hundreds of species of unique "
"flora and fauna were rendered extinct, and entire tribes of Argonians were "
"lost. Even the Legion suffered significant casualties. Hundreds of soldiers "
"were lost to \"\"swamp lung\"\" and gas explosions before they escaped the "
"scalding heat of the fire. It was a devastating blow to both the Legion and "
"the Argonians. This marked the end of the second campaign, and the end of "
"Sardecus' tenure as general. Soon after the legion's retreat, he fell ill "
"and passed to Aetherius before making it back to Imperial City. The official "
"diagnosis was acute infection from a wound he sustained on the way out of "
"the Marsh. The soldiers of the Legion weren't so sure.\n"
"\n"
" The true circumstances of Sardecus' death are still a matter of historical "
"debate. As for me, I do not rule out Shadowscale involvement. While we know "
"next to nothing about their organization or methodology, I think that we can "
"safely assume they played some role in the conflict. The mysterious death of "
"a high-ranking general directly following a disaster like the Great Burn …. "
"If my study of history has taught me anything, it's that there is no such "
"thing as coincidence."

"General Sardecus was a near-legendary figure in the Imperial military. A "
"veteran of countless campaigns, Sardecus had distinguished himself on many "
"occasions as both a soldier and a general. \n"
"\n"
"Sardecus (or Sardecus the Rock) was everything that the missing and assumed "
"slain General Bucco was not. Eyewitness accounts depict him as a stout and "
"humorless man with sharp, hawk-like features. He walked with a limp (a "
"lingering injury from the Battle of Argonia) and spoke in short, gravely "
"sentences that commanded obedience. He eschewed all formal dress and "
"regalia, preferring to wear a simple centurion's panoply with a white crest "
"to signify his station. \n"
"\n"
"Sardecus and the reconstituted Fourth Legion wasted no time resuming the war "
"effort. By 1E 2823, they had regained all the territory lost when Bucco "
"retreated. Military scholars attribute this success to Sardecus' "
"adaptability and tactical creativity. For instance, Sardecus ordered that "
"all legionnaires abandon their metal armor in favor of padded leather "
"jackets. Imperial quartermasters coordinated with Argonian irregulars and "
"scouts—learning how to subsist on food procured from the swamp alone. Also, "
"centurions and legates were given additional authority such that they could "
"fight independently when the legion became fractured. Allowing cohorts and "
"maniples to function independently had a surprisingly positive effect on "
"soldier morale. For the first time, legionnaires were able to see their "
"primary commanders and could follow them into battle personally. Of course, "
"much depended on the proficiency and leadership capabilities of the legates. "
" But Sardecus was a notoriously demanding commander and would not hesitate "
"to strip a soldier of rank if he or she fell short of expectations. \n"
"\n"
"Sardecus' greatest success, however, was in the diplomatic arena. Early in "
"the conflict, he reached out to disenfranchised Argonian tribes and offered "
"them rewards for joining the war effort on the side of the Empire. The "
"fallen Bucco (and many of his contemporaries) viewed the Lizard-Folk as a "
"singular bloc of barbarians, united by low breeding and savage tempers. "
"Sardecus saw through this deception almost immediately. He secured solid "
"alliances with several influential tribes, including the treacherous "
"Archeins and Shoss-kaleel. Suddenly his forces were nearly tripled. The war "
"for Black Marsh was finally swinging in the Empire's favor."

"By 1E 2820, General Bucco's fourth legion was utterly decimated.  What few "
"troops remained were completely unable to defend themselves. After a near "
"mutiny almost saw Bucco ousted from his own command, he finally ordered his "
"remaining soldiers to retreat and exit the Marsh's interior. His prevailing "
"assumption was that if the legion left the swamp, the Argonians would not "
"follow. \n"
"\n"
"After a withering ten-day withdrawal, what was left of the legion rallied at "
"the foot of an ancient Argonian pyramid known as \"\"Xi-tsei.\"\" The force "
"consisted of barely three-hundred-and-fifty swords by that point. Bucco "
"hoped that after a brief respite in the shadow of the pyramid, his remaining "
"forces could fall back to the relative safety of Cyrodiil. This wish went "
"unfulfilled. On the night of Last Seed 14, 1E 2820, what remained of Bucco's "
"proud Fourth Legion was annihilated. \n"
"\n"
"The specifics of the Xi-tsei massacre are a matter of much debate in the "
"historical community. While there is broad agreement that Bucco's remaining "
"forces were destroyed by a massive Argonian war party, the evidence "
"supporting such a conclusion is spotty at best. Archaeological excavations "
"around the pyramid found hundreds of bodies and discarded weapons, but the "
"remains of at least one-hundred legionnaires were never recovered. This, of "
"course, begs the question: what happened to those soldiers? There is no "
"evidence that they were able to make it back to Cyrodiil, which leads to the "
"possibility that they were taken prisoner. But excavations around known war "
"camps have found no evidence of legionnaire prisoners, either. This is just "
"another in a series of mysterious disappearances that occurred during the "
"conflict. Argonians may know more, but none have volunteered the information "
"to any historians.\n"
"\n"
"This crushing defeat in Black Marsh was the last embarrassment that the "
"Imperial Council could stand. Other hostile forces looked to Black Marsh and "
"became emboldened by the apparent weakness of the once-dreaded Legion. In "
"response to this, the Council reconstituted the Fourth Legion under the "
"command of General Regulus Sardecus and began the second campaign of the "
"Blackwater War."

"By 1E 2816, General Bucco's legion had been depleted to a mere six "
"cohorts—none of which were at full fighting strength as the campaign pressed "
"on. Endless raids, disease, and mysterious disappearances were compounding "
"on each other, creating a culture of utter hopelessness and cynicism. \n"
"\n"
"Seeing that the cause would be lost without reinforcements, Bucco called for "
"an additional legion to be deployed to Black Marsh. Rather than shifting "
"these fresh troops to the front to relieve his beleaguered force, he set "
"them to work building the \"\"Reman Way\"\" (later known as the Swamp Road). "
"Almost no one knew where the road went or what purpose it would serve in "

"legion's favor. \n"
"\n"
"In theory, the road should have been a boon to the Imperials. Lack of "

"The early years of the Blackwater War were not kind to the Imperial Legion. "
"The army which had claimed hundreds of victories on the rolling fields of "
"Cyrodiil was utterly unprepared to deal with the fetid bogs of Black Marsh. \n"
"\n"
"To begin with, the Legion's gear was ill-suited for such an environment. "
"Their armor, for instance, was heavy and prone to rust in the moist climate. "
"Legionaries spent hours scraping the mud from their boots and "
"shields—desperately trying to lighten the load they carried into battle. By "
"the end of the second year, legionnaires had abandoned their cuirasses and "
"greaves entirely, preferring to die comfortably rather than drenched in "
"sweat inside a metal suit.\n"
"\n"
"The battle tactics the Imperials had developed over the centuries were just "
"as useless as their armor in this inhospitable place. Their system of cohort "
"deployment and rigid line organization was impossible to implement in the "
"swampy interior. The thick cypress growth and sloppy terrain consistently "
"fragmented the group, resulting in a tangled mass of small skirmishes that "
"the Argonians routinely won. The chain of command deteriorated quickly in "
"such conditions. This rapidly gave way to rampant insubordination and morale-"
"draining power struggles among the troops.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the marsh itself seemed to devour whole cohorts time and time again."
" Rumors and half-truths constantly swirled around Legion campfires. Some "
"assumed that the missing cohorts became lost and disoriented, dying of "
"hunger and thirst before finding their way back to a safe location. Others "
"blamed the greatly feared \"\"Ghost Warriors,\"\" pale and hideous Argonians "
"of gruesome reputation. There were even whisperings about some dark and "
"malevolent creature lurking under the swamp that ate whole phalanxes in a "
"single bite. Such rumors were clearly false, but had a significant impact on "
"troop morale.\n"
"\n"
"This complication of setbacks and circumstances set the stage for years of "
"calamitous warfare. Thousands of soldiers would die before the end of "
"hostilities finally came to Black Marsh."

"When the invasion of Black Marsh began in 1E 2811, the Imperial Legion was "
"confident of victory. Imperial forces had won a great and decisive victory "
"in the Battle of Argonia, as well as in several other clashes. These battles "
"were one-sided affairs, with Argonians suffering significant casualties and "
"Imperials hardly getting winded. By First Seed 1E 2811, the Lizard-Folk were "
"in full retreat—taking refuge in the shadowy depths of the region's interior."
" The Empire decided to press the advantage and mount a full-scale invasion "
"before the Argonians could regroup. \n"
"\n"
"The column was led by a young and charismatic commander named Augurius Bucco."
" Bucco was a popular figure in Cyrodiil. His good looks and practiced "
"oratory catapulted him through the ranks of the Legion hierarchy with "
"unprecedented speed. By the time he was twenty-five he was already wearing "
"the General's Diamond. Upon receiving his generalship he was offered legions "
"in practically every corner of Cyrodiil. He chose the Fourth Legion of Black "
"Marsh as his command. \n"
"\n"
"Other historians have offered countless theories as to why he would choose "
"such a bleak and dangerous post. As for me, I would propose that simple "
"pride was the determining factor. Rumors of the Legion's successes along the "
"Black Marsh border had reached the inns and alleys of Imperial City as early "
"as Rain's Hand, 1E 2811. Seeing the swamp's conquest as his ticket to Grand "
"Marshal, Bucco greedily took on the mantle of Fourth Legion commander, "
"convinced the war for Black Marsh would be a quick and glorious affair. He "
"could not have been more wrong."

"Dryskins often ask me about the teeba-hatsei. They see the ball and the "
"court and say all kinds of funny things. Today the Tall-Elf I travel with "
"pointed to the court and asked, \"\"This is a garden, yes?\"\" I did not "
"know how to respond, so I just blinked at him. What kind of garden grows no "
"food? Tall-Elves can be very stupid. Still, I think I should write down the "
"rules so people ask me fewer questions.\n"
"\n"
"Teeba-hatsei means something like \"\"hip and tail ball\"\" in the dry "
"tongue. All of us play it—some better than others. I was never very good. My "
"arms are too long and my tail is too thin. The best teeba-players are short "
"and bulky, with broad tails like crocodiles and hips that swing like bags of "
"cinnamon-grass.\n"
"\n"
"The game is played on a broad field of dry mud and salt-meadow hay. On "
"either end of the field is a wall of mud and eeto cane. The size of the "
"field and the height of the wall vary from village to village. In Xiniss, "
"for example, the wall is twenty hands tall. Two reed hoops are suspended "
"over the field. One is about thirty hands high. The other is about fifty. "
"Again, this varies. For example, the Tum-Taleel tend to set their hoops "
"lower as they are fat and stupid and cannot jump very high.\n"
"\n"
"Each team consists of five players. The game begins by tossing the ball (or "
"teeba) skyward. Each team tries to hit the ball with their hips, elbows, or "
"tails. This can hurt a bit since the teeba is very heavy and made of depasa "
"gum. Some players wear pads of wood and dried wasso leaves to protect "
"themselves, but most Saxhleel make fun of them for doing so. \n"
"\n"
"The teeba is volleyed back and forth between the teams, with each player "
"trying to strike the opposing wall with the ball. If they succeed, their "
"team earns a point. Teamwork is very important. One player may tap the teeba "
"upward so a second player can swat it with their tail. Tail-strikes tend to "
"be much stronger. This continues until one of the teams has scored ten "
"points. \n"
"\n"
"Teams can earn three points by hitting the ball through the lower reed hoop. "
"This is very difficult to do though, since the hole is so small. If a player "
"is able to get the ball through the upper hoop, the game is over and "
"whichever team has the highest score at that time is declared the winner.\n"
"\n"
"There is, of course, much more to it. But this primer should at least keep "
"the scaleless ones from trying to pitch their tents in the middle of the "
"court."

"I've been pestering Mach-Makka for days. While I've learned a tremendous "
"amount about Argonian cuisine, there is still one dish I have not tried: the "
"Aojee-Sakka. Anytime I request it, Mach-Makka becomes agitated and serves me "
"something else. I suppose his hesitancy is understandable. The Aojee-Sakka "
"is among the most dangerous meals in all of Tamriel. \n"
"\n"
"The meal actually consists of two dishes served simultaneously. The primary "
"dish is a seared and delicately sliced Aojee Toad on a bed of caramelized "
"figs and cinnamon-grass. The second dish is a bowl of cold hosh (a dark and "
"viscous soup). Neither of these dishes can be consumed alone, as each is a "
"deadly poison. Rather, they must be eaten slowly and simultaneously. One "
"poison serves as the antidote to the other. Eating too much of the toad "
"leads to violent tremors and mouth frothing, followed by death. Eating too "
"much hosh leads to searing intestinal pain and vomiting, followed by death. "
"Not surprisingly, most people avoid this dish, chef and customer alike. But "
"my palate cannot be denied!\n"
"\n"
"I believe that Mach-Makka is at least considering my request. I've brought a "
"small fortune in gold and signed a half-dozen bizarre snake-skin documents "
"(which I can only assume are waivers of some kind). I can practically taste "
"the toad already. My culinary adventure is almost complete!\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"I return this book to you, Rallaume-friend. I try to cook Rallaume other "
"foods, but he demands Aojee-Sakka. I cook it for him, but he eats it wrong. "
"Too much toad. I am very sorry he dies.  \n"
"\n"
"Have a good life! We hope you come eat with us, too! But not the Aojee-Sakka."

"Mach-Makka has been hard at work the last few days. He's been preparing a "
"meal that I didn't even know existed. How marvelous! His assistant told me "
"that the locals call it a \"\"nagahssee\"\" which translates to something "
"like \"\"snake roll,\"\" I think. \"\"Snake stocking\"\" would probably be "
"more appropriate. More on that in a moment.\n"
"\n"
"The process begins by catching a wasso hedge snake. Apparently Mach-Makka "
"only trusts one local snake dealer—a sharp-faced hunter named Paxit. In "
"talking to Paxit, I found out that picking a reputable snake dealer is of "
"paramount importance when preparing nagahssee. You see, the wasso hedge "
"snake looks almost exactly like the red hooped tree-viper. Eating the former "
"will give you a full belly. Eating the latter will kill you before you leave "
"the table. I was delighted to hear this story. Dangerous food is something "
"of an obsession for me!\n"
"\n"
"Once the chef has acquired a snake, he or she goes to work disemboweling it. "
"The snake's interior is used in a number of other dishes, but nagahssee only "
"requires the skin. The empty skin is packed with a mix of wild marsh rice, "
"dried parsnips, sliced bark-ear mushrooms, and a live mouse! Paxit explained "
"to me that nagahssee is a unique dish that always changes. Those who choose "
"to eat the dish when it is first prepared are treated to the fresh vegetable "
"medley and the lean, wriggling meat of the mouse. But those who choose to "
"let the dish rest for a few hours (or even days) are richly rewarded for "
"their patience. The longer the dish rests, the fatter the mouse becomes. It "
"can spend a great deal of time feasting on the rice and parsnips before "
"finally expiring. An average nagahssee takes about five days to \"\"ripen."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Hearing all this, I couldn't wait to get my hands on one. I selected a roll "
"that had been resting for the better part of two days. I still heard a faint "
"squeaking from beneath the skin. I think I'll wait a bit longer before I "
"take my first bite!"

"Today Mach-Makka took me on a tour of his impressive caterpillar farm. Of "
"course, I use the term \"\"farm\"\" loosely. In actual fact, the farm is "
"just a series of small reed enclosures that each house hundreds of "
"caterpillars. I was shocked by the sheer variety. I saw long caterpillars, "
"fat caterpillars, orange and purple-striped caterpillars—I've never seen "
"such diversity! I asked a few questions, but Mach-Makka's limited mastery of "
"Cyrodilic continues to interfere with our repartee. I've attempted to learn "
"some Jel to bridge the language gap, but it is slow going to be sure. Still, "
"he tries to help me along. I'm told that he thinks I'm hilarious. Of course, "
"it's impossible to tell such things with Argonians.\n"
"\n"
"I asked if he ate the caterpillars and he seemed amused by this. He simply "
"shook his head and took me into a larger enclosure. When he ignited the "
"lamp, the room burst into a spray of colors. Huge butterflies and moths "
"erupted from the walls, dancing around the lamp in a cyclone of beating "
"wings. He gestured at some of the larger specimens and spoke at length in "
"pig-Cyrodilic. He encouraged me to grab a few before leaving the enclosure. \n"
"\n"
"Eating moths and butterflies is a challenging but rewarding culinary "
"experience.  Most outsiders who are brave enough to sample the local cuisine "
"remove the wings before eating. Mach-Makka offered to remove them for me, "
"but I refused. He said something to his assistant in Jel and for a moment "
"both seemed mildly amused. That probably means Mach-Makka said something "
"fantastically funny. A few moments later, he served me five Green Slipper-"
"Tails in a traditional \"\"ajum\"\" (a woven tray with a netted lid). I set "
"upon them with relish! \n"
"\n"
"A truly satisfying butterfly dish hinges on the delicate art of "
"\"\"Iuheeez,\"\" or \"\"wing folding.\"\" Argonian master chefs use their "
"claws to bend and fold the wings into tiny but ornate edible sculptures. "
"Unfortunately, local custom dictates that outsiders fold their own wings. I "
"made my best effort to replicate the simplest \"\"Xeech\"\" fold, but I "
"wound up making quite a mess. Even so, the meal was delicious. Green Slipper-"
"Tails are perhaps the sweetest of the Slipper-Tails species—tasting of honey-"
"grass with a sweet but chalky finish. Hopefully, I'm provided with many more "
"opportunities to master butterfly cuisine!"

"\n"
"At last, I've reached the verdant swamps of Black Marsh! I've always yearned "
"for an opportunity to sample authentic Argonian cuisine. Now, at long last, "
"the moment has arrived! I've decided to begin with a regional delicacy—slugs."
"\n"
"\n"
"Like all good Argonian fare, slugs are frequently served raw and often with "
"a sprig of salt-meadow leaf.  I was only able to sample three types during "
"this visit. My chef's accent was very thick, but I believe the limited fare "
"had something to do with the season. I've learned that swamp seasons change "
"as quickly as the wind. So there may well be a whole new array to choose "
"from in a few days. I can only hope that they are as flavorful as what I "
"sampled today!\n"
"\n"
"Bearded Blue\n"
"This indigo beauty is quite common in the bogs surrounding Tsofeer Cavern. "
"It's roughly the size of a Nord's  thumb and features a shaggy clump of "
"tentacles beneath its long eye stalks. The slug features a subtle aroma, but "
"it also has refreshingly citrusy undertones. The extra tentacles give the "
"Bearded Blue a unique texture that can be a little distracting (particularly "
"when consumed alive), but it tastes simply divine.  The flavor is earth-"
"driven with subdued loamy notes hidden below a firm citrusy bite. I was most "
"struck by the crisp finish. Quite a treat!\n"
"\n"
"Black-Banded Slider\n"
"The Black-Banded Slider is something of a local staple. It is often smoked "
"and eaten on a bed of weevil larvae and orange-grass, but I insisted on "
"tasting it raw. The slug excretes an acrid black oil when disturbed, but it "
"was easily wiped away to reveal a long body with a series of broad black "
"stripes across a pale, creamy mantle. Even washed, the Black-Banded Slider "
"presents a chewy, tannic flavor that must be endured to reach the clean and "
"nuanced aftertaste that the Argonians seem to relish. It's a mellow, almost "
"floral flourish to an otherwise imposing meal.\n"
"\n"
"King Yellow\n"
"I was delighted to hear that the King Yellow was in season. This is a truly "
"massive creature; roughly as long as my forearm and covered in a vast forest "
"of fleshy, undulating bristles! It's always difficult to tell with "
"Argonians, but I think that my chef was very surprised to hear my request "
"for one served raw. He placed the beast in front of me, wrapped in a wasso "
"nut leaf with an indigo lily garnish. I was immediately struck by the rich "
"bouquet of mossy, herbaceous scents. You can practically smell all of Black "
"Marsh in the creature's mucous excretions. Each bite brought on a new wave "
"of astonishing flavor. The brooding, nutty tang of the tail meat eventually "
"gave way to the thick, oily bitters of the mantle. At last, I reached the "
"head. I'm hard pressed to think of a more alarming eruption of flavor! A "
"cloying, buttery taste that swings wildly toward a dry, mustardy finish. "
"Spectacular!\n"
"\n"
"I left the table with a heavy heart, knowing that I will likely not be able "
"to taste the King Yellow again for another season. But I'm buoyed by the "
"knowledge that tomorrow will bring a grand, new culinary adventure. This "
"time, beetle larvae! I can hardly wait!"

"By Peek-Ereel, Friend and Confidant to Keshu the Black Fin\n"
"\n"
"Keshu's war against the House Dres slavers continued for a number of "
"seasons, and with every victory the Black Fin Legion notched, her army of "
"loyal Saxhleel expanded. They came from far and wide to pledge themselves to "
"her banner: slaves liberated from Dark Elf holdings; adventurous Saxhleel "
"from widely separated villages; even a few citified Argonians from Stormhold "
"and locations beyond the influence of the Hist. \n"
"\n"
"I had finally completed my rites of maturity and was now considered a full-"
"fledged adult in the eyes of the tribe. I was trying to decide what I wanted "
"to do with the rest of my existence. As much as I loved Keshu and believed "
"in her cause, I did not want to be a soldier or a freedom fighter. I wanted "
"a simpler life, something in service to the Hist or the Xal-Uxith. I was "
"destined to become a sap-speaker or an egg-tender, or so I believed at the "
"time. So I decided to let Keshu know my desires and withdraw from the Black "
"Fin Legion.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu understood my situation and agreed to release me from my obligation. I "
"was still with the Legion, however, when Tee-Wan returned to camp. He was "
"Keshu's spy-master now, ranging into the field for days or weeks at a time "
"to gather information for the Black Fin Legion to use against the forces of "
"House Dres. The news he brought back with him this time, however, dealt with "
"a much larger, more dangerous foe. \"\"Outsiders from across the far ocean "
"have invaded the land of Skyrim,\"\" Tee-Wan explained. \"\"I bring a "
"message for you from the Nord who helped us in Stormhold, Jorunn the bard."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Jorunn's message explained that an enemy called the Akaviri had laid siege "
"to the city of Windhelm and was now marching toward Mournhold. Jorunn's "
"sister had fallen and he had temporarily taken command of the Nord forces. "
"\"\"I go to aid the Dark Elves to try to stop this vile invasion,\"\" Jorunn "
"had written. \"\"I would not mind in the slightest if you decided to return "
"that favor you owe me and join us in Morrowind. Your Argonian shell-backs "
"could certainly help turn the tide of this conflict.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I could tell by the look in Keshu's eyes that she had already decided to go "
"to Jorunn's aid. \"\"Vos-Huruk, Fire-From-Nothing,\"\" Keshu called to her "
"chief lieutenants, \"\"rally the troops. Today, the Black Fin Legion goes to "
"war.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I wished Keshu and the others cool breezes and clear water, but I wasn't "
"going to join them on this adventure. I was going home, back to Seekhat-Xol. "
"I assumed they would be back after the moons had moved through a few of "
"their cycles, but I was wrong. I would not see Keshu again for more than ten "
"cycles of the calendar, and by that time she would be much changed.\n"
"\n"
"But word would reach us even in isolated Seekhat-Xol. We heard that the "
"Akaviri were defeated, thanks to the combined efforts of the Nords and Dark "
"Elves—and the timely intervention of a phalanx of Argonian warriors. On that "
"day, the Ebonheart Pact was born. Keshu and her legion stayed in allied "
"lands after the Akaviri threat was dealt with, helping to establish the "
"parameters of the newly formed alliance and securing the freedom of Saxhleel "
"for as long as the Pact survived. She spent time touring Skyrim and "
"Morrowind, helped crush rebellions, and defended the borders from competing "
"alliances before eventually taking up arms in the Three Banners War.\n"
"\n"
"Do I regret not joining Keshu on that mighty adventure? Sometimes. But I "
"would not trade my time in Seekhat-Xol as an egg-tender for anything—not "
"even to fight at Keshu's side once more."

"By Peek-Ereel, Friend and Confidant to Keshu the Black Fin\n"
"\n"
"In the season following Keshu the Black Fin's return from the ruins of the "
"Old Ones (as she referred to the so-called advanced Saxhleel who lived in "
"the distant past), we were extremely busy, breathing life into Keshu's hopes "
"and desires. In addition to learning some small amount about the way the Old "
"Ones lived, Keshu's time of contemplation among the ruins saw the "
"development of new ways of thinking for our leader and life-long friend. She "
"came back to us with a dream.\n"
"\n"
"Some will tell you that from the moment she returned from the ruins, Keshu "
"wanted to bring about the resurrection of the advanced Saxhleel society. "
"Now, while she was definitely interested in learning more about that ancient "
"time, her initial dream was much simpler. She wanted to defend the Saxhleel "
"from the threat of outsiders. When Xocin was captured by the Dark Elf "
"slavers, I think it affected Keshu on a profound level. And when she freed "
"Xocin and the other Saxhleel captives, I think her destiny was set in motion."
"\n"
"\n"
"Keshu decided to create an army. She called for volunteers from across the "
"greater marsh, and a surprising number answered that call. The village "
"elders, tree-minders, and sap-speakers were of mixed minds about her "
"actions, but in the end they decided to sit back and let the Hist sort it "
"out. As with all things in Saxhleel life, if Keshu succeeded then her plans "
"were meant to come to fruition. And if she failed? Then she would disappear "
"into the swamp and never be heard from again. That was the way things "
"happened in Black Marsh. But whatever Keshu's ultimate fate, in the "
"beginning she was unstoppable.\n"
"\n"
"The initial band—informally known as the Black Fin's Legion—was more than "
"two dozen strong. Keshu and Vos-Huruk at first served as instructors and "
"trainers for the small gathering of warriors, but soon other notable "
"fighters had rallied to her banner, including the battle mage known as Fire-"
"From-Nowhere and the Saxhleel freedom fighter called Elf-Slayer. They "
"provided expertise and helped with the training to reduce the burden on our "
"beloved leader. When Keshu determined that we were at last ready to be "
"tested, she decided on a target and pointed her newly honed weapon at it. We "
"were going to attack a House Dres slave caravan and set the captives free.\n"
"\n"
"We planned and trained for weeks, preparing for every contingency Keshu and "
"her most-trusted advisors could think of. We scouted the House Dres enclave. "
"We reconnoitered the most probable paths from Stormhold toward Morrowind. We "
"watched. We waited. And then we made our move.\n"
"\n"
"The House Dres slave caravan departed from Stormhold on a rainy morning with "
"little fanfare. A line of Saxhleel slaves consisting of more than fifty of "
"our egg-brothers and egg-sisters were chained together and forced to march "
"between two massive wagons, each pulled by a team of guar. House Dres guards "
"rode atop the wagons, marched on each side of the line of slaves, and ranged "
"around the caravan atop horses and other riding beasts. In all, there were "
"about thirty Dark Elf warriors guarding the caravan. For this exercise, "
"Keshu led a force of twenty-six Black Fin Legionaries to liberate the slaves."
"\n"
"\n"
"Our warriors were nervous. For the majority of them, this would be their "
"first real battle, and though they were well trained and committed to "
"Keshu's cause, they still suffered from the usual fears associated with "
"entering a life-or-death situation. Keshu and her officers remained visible, "
"displaying confidence and determination that went a long way toward calming "
"our troops. We set up to ambush the caravan as it made its way through a "
"narrow passage a few hundred strides from the border of Morrowind. Keshu "
"gave the signal as she rushed forward to meet the enemy. We followed, "
"spilling from our hiding places like wood ants emerging from a rotten log. "
"If we were still nervous, it didn't show as we fell upon the Dark Elves.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu's strategy worked perfectly. When the battle was over, the Dark Elf "
"guards were either dead or had surrendered, and though we had suffered a few "
"minor wounds, none of the Black Fin Legion had fallen. The mission went off "
"flawlessly and Keshu's reputation grew with every Saxhleel captive we set "
"free."

"By Peek-Ereel, Friend and Confidant to Keshu the Black Fin\n"
"\n"
"My tale of the younger days of Keshu, war hero and founder of the movement "
"for an advanced Saxhleel society, continues. Our travels beyond the village "
"of Seekhat-Xol, the village where we grew up, proceeded, with Keshu "
"determining every step we took through the greater marsh. Our company had "
"grown from the five of us to a group of more than a dozen. Most of the "
"slaves we freed from the House Dres enclave in Stormhold had departed, "
"seeking to make their way back to homes and families. But not all of them "
"had something to return to. And, it seemed, Keshu was developing into as "
"charismatic and popular a leader as Jorunn the Nord, who we met in Stormhold."
"\n"
"\n"
"Keshu had always been fascinated by the tales of an advanced Saxhleel "
"society that supposedly thrived in the distant past. For this part of our "
"journey, she was determined to visit the site of one of these ancient cities."
" We followed clues contained in an old book she had borrowed from our "
"teacher, the raj-deelith, Drameencin, and traveled deeper into the marsh. We "
"moved through a portion of the swamp that was as dangerous to Saxhleel as it "
"was to scaleless outsiders. In addition to strange predators and clouds of "
"noxious poison that drifted casually on the breeze, we also had to contend "
"with meat-eating plants, ambulatory mounds of flesh-dissolving mud, and "
"swarms of hungry insects. But we were adult Saxhleel, tested and proven "
"strong (well, except for me, who still had to complete my rites of "
"maturity), and the great and powerful Black Fin was our leader. The swamp "
"never stood a chance.\n"
"\n"
"We wandered for a time, trying to locate a specific landmark in the "
"bleakness of the deep marsh. According to Keshu's book, we were looking for "
"two huge shining cypress trees, their trunks twisted by age and proximity so "
"that they were intertwined like a thick, knotted rope. It was Tee-Wan who "
"eventually found the tangled trees, calling out his discovery with a mix of "
"excitement and dread. For beyond the trees, looming like a mountain from the "
"murky water of the swamp, was the ancient stone ruins of the advanced "
"Saxhleel civilization.\n"
"\n"
"The ruins waited before us, consisting of equal parts oppressive stone and "
"dark shadow. Most of us were wary if not outright fearful of approaching the "
"place. How could true Saxhleel have tolerated living in such a structure? "
"But Keshu displayed not a hint of the fear the rest of us were feeling. In "
"fact, her face shone with wonder and excitement. Before any of us could stop "
"her, she was racing up the stone steps toward the top of the xanmeer, "
"anxious to discover the secrets of the lost civilization. When she saw that "
"the rest of us were hanging back, she returned and addressed our group.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Vos-Huruk,\"\" Keshu said, \"\"lead the group back to Seekhat-Xol. I "
"will follow and meet you there shortly.\"\" We were worried about Keshu "
"remaining among the ruins by herself, but we were also eager to return to "
"our village. \"\"What will you do out here?\"\" I asked. Keshu erected the "
"spine of compassion and simply replied, \"\"Learn whatever I can.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"We had been back in the village for almost the entire cycle of the moons "
"when Keshu emerged from the swamp and returned to Seekhat-Xol. She received "
"a hero's welcome, for the stories of our adventures had grown with each "
"telling, and Keshu was considered to be the greatest of us all. She never "

"By Peek-Ereel, Friend and Confidant to Keshu the Black Fin\n"
"\n"
"Our visit to Stormhold had taken a bad turn, like a sudden storm appearing "
"on an otherwise sunny day. Xocin and Tee-Wan had decided to explore the city "
"on their own while Keshu, Vos-Huruk, and I spent the evening with our new "
"Nord friends. When Tee-Wan returned, he was alone. He explained that Dark "
"Elf slavers had taken Xocin captive. Keshu, of course, planned to rescue him."
" And, much to our surprise, Jorunn the bard, leader of our new Nord friends, "
"wanted to assist us. \"\"Nothing gets the blood running like busting a few "
"Dark Elf heads for a good cause,\"\" he proclaimed in his deep, booming "
"voice.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu and Jorunn led the way to the Dark Elf enclave on the edge of the city."
" \"\"House Dres,\"\" Jorunn said, but it came out more as a curse than a "
"name. \"\"I should have known.\"\" We scouted the enclave, taking note of "
"where guards were positioned and how they moved about the encampment. We "
"determined where the newly acquired slaves were being held and began to "
"formulate a plan for setting them free. Keshu led the discussion on strategy "
"and Jorunn listened carefully, interjecting a suggestion every so often but "
"otherwise agreeing with her plan. Just as the sun began to rise in the sky, "
"four Saxhleel and five Nords went to war with the House Dres slaver's "
"enclave. And the battle was glorious!\n"
"\n"
"Launching a surprise attack on an overconfident and unprepared enemy is "
"easier than you might imagine. Especially when you have a handful of "
"overeager, half-drunk Nords at your side. Keshu and Jorunn fought like "
"whirlwinds, carving a path to the slave pen while the rest of us dealt with "
"arriving reinforcements. It took the Dark Elves more time than we expected "
"to get their defenses together. The late hour and the unexpected assault "
"seemed to have totally flummoxed the slavers' usual routine. Jorunn "
"explained that they were used to defending their caravans in the wild, but "
"no one had ever had the audacity to strike at the heart of a Dres enclave. "
"\"\"And that's why your plan is going to succeed,\"\" he said to Keshu.\n"
"\n"
"With relative ease, Keshu dispatched the guards trying to protect the gate "
"to the slave pen. Jorunn stepped into the opening she created and smashed "
"off the pen's lock with a single swipe of his massive battleaxe. Xocin "
"emerged from the pen, leading a band of disheveled Saxhleel out of the "
"confined space. By this time, the Dark Elves had rallied and were advancing "
"on our position. \"\"We're about to have company, Black Fin,\"\" Vos-Huruk "
"warned. \"\"And they have mages with them,\"\" I added. Keshu began giving "
"orders, ready to fight to the last of us if that was what was required. But "
"Jorunn had a different idea.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Not every battle needs to be to the death, my Argonian friend,\"\" the "
"big Nord said with a twinkle in his eyes. \"\"Take your people and make your "
"escape. My companions and I will keep the puny Elves occupied while you slip "
"away.\"\" Keshu thanked him and promised to return the favor someday. \"\"I "
"may just hold you to that promise,\"\" Jorunn laughed as he turned to face "
"the oncoming slavers. \"\"Someday.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Keshu led us and the newly released slaves into the marsh as Jorunn and his "
"companions took up our defense. The Nords fought with gusto, and we could "
"hear them laughing and singing battle songs as we disappeared into the swamp."
" After we had run for nearly as long as it took the sun to reach the top of "
"the sky, Keshu called for us to halt. She asked me to return to the city and "
"make sure the Nords had survived the assault on the slavers' enclave. Tee-"
"Wan, skilled at stealth and deception, offered to accompany me. We set out "
"immediately while Keshu talked to the now-freed slaves.\n"
"\n"
"We slipped back into Stormhold as quietly and unobtrusively as we could. The "
"enclave was sealed up tight and a large contingent of guards had arrived to "
"bolster its defenses. Tee-Wan and I made our way back to the inn. We found "
"Jorunn and his companions there, appearing no worse for the morning's battle."
" He thanked us for showing concern and coming to check on him, but he told "
"us not to linger. \"\"The House Dres leader is very upset about losing his "
"slaves,\"\" Jorunn said. \"\"We're even getting ready to leave this "
"place—after we finish our meal and our mead. Tell Keshu I look forward to "
"our next encounter.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And with that, Tee-Wan and I left the city of Stormhold and made our way "
"back to Keshu and the others."

"By Peek-Ereel, Friend and Confidant to Keshu the Black Fin\n"
"\n"
"One of the first things Keshu the Black Fin, war hero and founder of the "
"movement for an advanced Saxhleel society, decided after completing her "
"rites of maturity and earning her place as a Saxhleel adult was to undertake "
"a journey to learn more about the world beyond our tiny village. With sly "
"Tee-Wan, mighty Vos-Huruk, crafty Xocin, and myself beside her, Keshu said "
"farewell to the village and our teacher, the raj-deelith, Drameencin, and "
"set off to see the wonders that waited beyond the familiar confines of "
"Seekhat-Xol.\n"
"\n"
"We headed north, stopping at each village along the way to visit friends and "
"family members as we made our way toward the legendary city of Stormhold. In "
"the village of Zurook, we were warned to avoid the Dark Elf enclaves in "
"Stormhold, as they were notorious for capturing lone Saxhleel and shipping "
"them off to serve as slaves back in Morrowind. We had heard rumors about "
"Dark Elf slavers as we were growing up, but we never quite believed the "
"tales in our secluded part of the greater marsh.\n"
"\n"
"We arrived in Stormhold with the rest of the throng of visitors—traders, "
"mercenaries, crafters, and the most diverse group of people we had ever seen."
" In addition to the obviously citified Saxhleel (who we learned were called "
"Argonians by the other races), we gaped in wonder at the giant Nords, the "
"fair-skinned High Elves, the flamboyant Bretons, the brooding Dark Elves, "
"and even the few Khajiit and Wood Elves that wandered the squares. \n"
"\n"
"They were all strange and exotic to us, and we saw first-hand how some of "
"our egg-brothers and egg-sisters were treated by the outsiders. Some, like "
"the powerful and dignified city-dwellers, were bowed down to and venerated. "
"While others, obviously weaker and poorer, were ordered about, denigrated, "
"and even beaten, depending upon the whims of their masters. We were shocked "
"and appalled, but Keshu ordered us to remain calm. \"\"We can't change the "
"course of this river,\"\" she said. \"\"At least, not this day.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"During our exploration of the city, we happened upon a group of young Nords "
"and their charismatic leader, the bard named Jorunn. We listened to Jorunn "
"perform, fascinated by the stories he told and captivated by his clear and "
"expressive voice. He noticed our intense interest, particularly that of "
"Keshu, and invited us to join him and his companions for the evening meal. "
"Keshu and Jorunn became fast friends, speaking of many things long into the "
"night. It turns out, he and his companions weren't much older than we were "
"and they were also traveling to see the world before the responsibilities of "
"adulthood caught up with them. While we taught Jorunn and his friends how to "
"eat and drink traditional Saxhleel fare, they exposed us to the Nord "
"delicacies that were available at the inn. \n"
"\n"
"I didn't listen to everything that Jorunn and Keshu discussed that night, "
"but I heard some of it. Jorunn spoke of his family, the wonders of Skyrim, "
"and his hope to someday become a famous bard. He explained that his sister "
"was going to be Queen of the Nords, but I assumed that was just another one "
"of his fanciful stories. I'm not sure what Keshu believed. For her part, "
"Keshu told Jorunn about life in the marsh, what it meant to be a Saxhleel, "
"and how our people had once commanded a much more advanced civilization. He "
"appeared to be genuinely fascinated by everything she said. As the fire in "
"the hearth burned down to embers and the tankards of Nord mead and Saxhleel "
"bile beer were finally emptied, Tee-Wan came rushing in. \"\"Xocin,\"\" he "
"said, his voice cracking with fear and sorrow, \"\"he's been taken by the "
"slavers.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Keshu never hesitated. She rose and ordered us to action. She had no "
"intention of allowing the Dark Elves to take our egg-brother away in chains. "
"Before we could gather our weapons and head out, Jorunn stood. \"\"Friends "
"don't let friends rush off to battle by themselves,\"\" the big Nord "
"declared. \"\"Besides, we haven't gotten into a good brawl since last Turdas."
" My companions get cranky when they go too long without a good brawl.\"\""

"\n"
"Our third and final trial on the way to complete our rites of maturity was "
"\"\"The Trial of the Stalking Hackwing.\"\" In some ways, this was the most "
"dangerous of the rites we had to participate in to earn a place in adult "
"society. Each of us was placed in a cage with a single, huge hackwing. The "
"predatory bird was a vicious creature, strong and confident, every bit as "
"capable a hunter as any of us—and it had the ability to fly. We had to allow "
"the giant bird to attack us and draw blood. If we knew what we were doing, "
"we let it strike so as to bloody us but not incapacitate us. Then the "
"hackwing was released. Our goal: catch and kill the hackwing that marked us "
"before it could do the same to us.\n"
"\n"
"Vos-Huruk and Xocin each took a beak strike to the leg. Both wounds were "
"superficial, drawing blood but not ripping muscle or breaking bone. Tee-Wan "
"allowed the hackwing to pierce his left arm, cutting a long but shallow line "
"from his elbow to his shoulder. Keshu miscalculated a leap back and allowed "
"her bird to cut her across the temple, just above her right eye. But I "
"failed this part of the trial completely. I let the hackwing drive its sharp "
"beak directly into my chest. The healers said it barely missed my heart. "
"Even so, I was injured too badly to continue, and I would have to wait for "
"another season to complete my rites of maturity.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu wanted to check on me, make sure I was going to be all right. The raj-"
"nassa wouldn't hear of it, however, and ordered her to continue with her "
"trial—until either the Black Fin or the hackwing was dead. So with a final "
"glance to make sure the healer was assisting me, Keshu wiped blood out of "
"her eyes and ran into the wilderness. As was traditional, she had no weapon "
"or armor. Just her body and her wits. It was time for the hunter to survive "
"the hunt.\n"
"\n"
"Have you ever been stalked by a hungry hackwing? The experience can be "
"disconcerting and more than a little frightening. Often, you only hear the "
"beating of wings and the rush of air overheard. Sometimes you notice a "
"shadow pass by. Rarely, you catch a brief glimpse of a wing or a talon. And, "
"if you show the slightest weakness, the hackwing dives in and attempts to "
"wound you. Then it simply waits and follows until you collapse from loss of "
"blood. In the case of the rite, we were already bloodied by the hunting "
"birds. They were going to come after us—one way or another. The trick was "
"going to be in anticipating the attack and countering it with an attack of "
"our own.\n"
"\n"
"(I keep saying \"\"our,\"\" but realize I was effectively out of the test. I "
"was injured and weak and barely conscious for most of the remaining portion "
"of the trial, only learning what happened later, after I was healed and the "
"rites were concluded for the season.)\n"
"\n"
"Keshu led her hackwing into a portion of the marsh where open sky was at a "
"premium. She wanted to use the tree trunks and leaf canopy to her advantage, "
"cutting off all but the most direct paths between the hackwing and her "
"present location. She moved deeper into the trees, flattening out the "
"approach so that when the hackwing finally attacked, it would have to come "
"for her not from above but from a horizontal direction at more or less "
"ground level. \n"
"\n"
"As Keshu waited for her predator and her prey, she broke a sturdy branch "
"from one of the trees at a steep angle, creating a makeshift spear with a "
"ragged yet pointed edge. She braced the spear and her back against the tree "
"trunk behind her and positioned the point so she could raise it quickly when "
"the hackwing appeared. She didn't have to wait long. Thinking that its prey "
"had finally succumbed to blood loss and stopped to die within the cluster of "
"trees, the hackwing swooped down and flew toward Keshu along the exact path "
"she had planned. At the very last moment, Keshu angled the spear up and let "
"the hackwing's speed and trajectory do all the work.\n"
"\n"
"The hunt was over. Keshu was victorious. She had completed her rites of "
"maturity and was ready to take her place as an adult member of the community."
" And the first thing she did was rush back to make sure I was still alive."

"By Peek-Ereel, Friend and Confidant to Keshu the Black Fin\n"
"\n"
"The first of our three difficult tests completed, it was now time to begin "
"our second rite of maturity. This was \"\"The Trial of the Perfect Bowl.\"\" "
"It was as much a test of our crafting skill as it was a test of humility and "
"confidence. The goal, we would discover later, was not necessarily to make "
"the most ornate and complicated bowl we could devise, but to demonstrate "
"that simple and utilitarian could also reveal perfection.\n"
"\n"
"The test consisted of three parts. First, we had to acquire the components "
"necessary to craft our bowls. Then we had to locate the hidden crafting "
"stations that had been set up in dangerous parts of the marsh for this "
"specific purpose. Finally, we had to craft our bowls and present them to the "
"raj-nassa for judgment—before the crafting stations succumbed to the "
"dangerous locations they were placed in. \n"
"\n"
"Each of us was provided with a specific material our bowls had to be "
"constructed from. For example, Tee-Wan had to secure the shell of a rare "
"three-clawed mudcrab, while I had to acquire the husk of a krona nut, and "
"Xocin needed to find the perfect branch from a dragon's tongue tree. While "
"each of these presented a particular challenge, we were afraid for Keshu "
"when we heard what her primary component had to be. She needed to steal an "
"egg from a haj mota nest! Not only were haj motas extremely protective of "
"their nests, the brittle shells of the haj mota egg were notoriously "
"difficult to work with. More often than not, the shells crack when not "
"worked with the utmost care and expertise.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu, now called \"\"the Black Fin\"\" as the tale of her success in the "
"first rite spread throughout the village, headed out to locate a haj mota "
"nest. Since she had met one of the massive creatures during the previous "
"trial, she decided to return to that area to start her quest. She spent an "
"entire day watching the marsh, observing the comings and goings of the haj "
"mota. It soon became evident that the creature was a doe and that it had a "
"nest somewhere nearby. Of course, there are few creatures as dangerous as a "
"mother haj mota protecting its eggs, and Keshu would have to tread carefully "
"to successfully complete this part of the trial, let alone survive to finish "
"the entire rite.\n"
"\n"
"Now, Keshu wanted to steal an egg from the nest, but she didn't want to harm "
"any of the remaining eggs or injure the haj mota in the process. She "
"believed in making as little mark as possible on the world as she passed "
"through it. So once again she set out to distract the haj mota and lead it "
"away from its nest. In this way, she hoped she could acquire an egg without "
"having to face the creature's wrath. This time, she gathered a bundle of "
"orange-grass and marsh roots—a combination that few haj motas can resist—and "
"used the intoxicating aroma (at least to the haj mota) to draw the creature "
"away from its nest. Then she tied the bundle to a water lizard and sent it "
"scurrying into the deeper marsh. The haj mota followed after it, leaving "
"Keshu's path to the nest clear.\n"
"\n"
"There were three eggs in the nest. Keshu didn't select the largest egg, or "
"the egg with the thickest shell. She took the smallest egg, because its "
"mottled shell looked smooth and perfect to her crafter's eyes. She saw the "
"bowl within it, waiting to emerge. What she hadn't seen, not until the last "
"possible moment, was the male haj mota stalking out of the marsh and heading "
"for the nest. She barely had enough time to slip away before the male "
"reached the nest and noticed that an egg was missing. She listened to its "
"roar, a mix of anger and loss, as she made her way to the crafting station.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu's crafting station was set atop a log platform above a massive patch "
"of deadly quicksand. She had to craft her bowl before the entire station "
"sank into the marsh. She worked quickly yet carefully, expertly removing the "
"very top of the egg to use as the basis for her bowl. She cleaned it, "
"polished it, and added the reagents that would strengthen the shell and make "
"it suitable for use as a vessel or container. She wrapped up her work and "
"bounded off the platform just as the mud sloshed over the top and began to "
"pull it completely into the marsh.\n"
"\n"
"As the raj-nassa examined each of our offerings in turn, we were able to "
"look upon some truly impressive feats of crafting. But it was evident that "
"Keshu had overtaken the field this season. Her bowl, crafted from the "
"simplest haj mota shell, was elegant in its modesty and beautiful in its "
"purity. It needed nothing but to be true to its natural form, and Keshu "
"masterfully let that natural form shine forth—even as she turned it from a "
"brittle shell into a strong, unbreakable bowl."

"By Peek-Ereel, Friend and Confidant to Keshu the Black Fin\n"
"\n"
"I remember our rites of maturity as though we took them yesterday. Keshu the "
"Black Fin, war hero and founder of the movement for an advanced Saxhleel "
"society, earned her sobriquet completing these tests—and she began to build "
"her reputation and solidify her relationship with the companions at this "
"time as well. All of the companions excelled in the tests: Keshu, Vos-Huruk, "
"Tee-Wan, Xocin, and even me (at least until the final test). Yes, we "
"accomplished great things, but much of the credit has to go to our "
"instructor and mentor, the raj-deelith, Drameencin.\n"
"\n"
"The elder teacher was ancient. Supposedly, he was old when our egg-parents "
"hatched from the communal nest. But age didn't seem to slow Drameencin. More "
"like a fine mold or a fermented ooze, he just got better with every passing "
"season. By the time we became his students, he was at the top of his craft "
"and we were poised to become his masterpieces. He followed the usual methods "
"of instructing young Saxhleel, making sure we conformed to the needs and "
"requirements of the community and teaching us advanced techniques for "
"hunting, tracking, and crafting. But he took us beyond the source of the "
"river to also enhance our peculiar talents. We weren't just interchangeable "
"eggs in a basket to Drameencin. We were individuals, and Keshu especially "
"thrived under his tutelage.\n"
"\n"
"The Saxhleel rites of maturity consist of tests of skill and bravery "
"conducted over the course of multiple days. Some of the tests are set, used "
"by every Saxhleel community throughout the greater marsh. Others change, "
"depending on location, time of season, or the specific tastes of a "
"community's raj-nassa (the elder leaders). Our rites included three "
"difficult tests. How Keshu performed at these tests showed what kind of "
"person she was blossoming into.\n"
"\n"
"The first of these tests was \"\"The Trial of the Lost Centipede.\"\" We "
"were each directed to reach into a barrel and pull forth a single marsh "
"centipede. If you've never seen a marsh centipede, they are excellent "
"specimens of great size and nasty temperament. The average marsh centipede "
"is as long as the span of your outstretched fingers and as thick as your "
"wrist. The centipede selected is decorated with a distinctive mark to "
"identify it. Then they are given to runners who race into the wilderness and "
"release them. Our test was to track our specific marsh centipede, capture "
"it, and return it to the raj-nassa alive and well. Now, tracking a specific "
"centipede through an overgrown marsh is no simple task. It takes skill, "
"patience, and even a bit of luck.\n"
"\n"
"Xocin recovered his centipede first, but in doing so he disturbed a haj mota."
" In order to elude the creature, he was forced to wade into a deadly patch "
"of quicksand. Keshu, who happened to be passing by at the time, distracted "
"the haj mota and sent it scrambling in the opposite direction. Then she "
"circled back and rescued Xocin from the sucking embrace of the pool of mud "
"and sand.\n"
"\n"
"By the time Keshu tracked down her centipede, it had gotten itself into a "
"terrible situation. A trio of hostile nagas was hunting the plump, many-"
"legged creature, hoping to make a meal out of it. To complete this part of "
"the maturity rites, Keshu could not allow that to happen. Without "
"hesitation, she slipped into the dark water and swam toward the trio, "
"submerged and hidden from view as she made her approach. Vos-Huruk, who was "
"returning to the village after collecting her own centipede, happened upon "
"the scene and watched as the event played out. She reported what happened "
"and now I am writing it down for posterity's sake.\n"
"\n"
"As the naga hunters circled and closed in on their prey, Keshu silently rose "
"from the dark water like a black fin on the prowl, a vicious dagger in each "
"hand and a look of determination in her eyes. She dispatched the first two "
"nagas with quick slashes of her blades, advancing toward the third before "
"her initial kills had barely sunk below the surface of the marsh. By the "
"time the last naga realized that death was fast-approaching, it was too late "
"to defend himself. He fell without providing even a token resistance to the "
"single-minded Keshu. She scooped up her centipede and followed Vos-Huruk "
"back to the raj-nassa."

"\n"
"Keshu the Black Fin, war hero and founder of the movement for an advanced "
"Saxhleel society, started out as just another one of my many egg-brothers "
"and egg-sisters. There wasn't anything overtly special about her when we "
"were growing up in the village of Seekhat-Xol. Not that I could see, anyway. "
"She played traditional games, ate traditional food, and learned to hunt and "
"track and fight. I guess if Keshu excelled at anything, it was tracking and "
"fighting. She took to these activities like a shap takes to water, out-"
"performing the rest of us with an ease that was almost supernatural.\n"
"\n"
"Keshu and I became friends almost from the moment we emerged from our eggs. "
"We were inseparable. We played together, did our chores and attended our "
"lessons together, growing up as all Saxhleel do. I suppose I began to notice "
"something different about Keshu during this period. She had a passion for "
"history that went beyond memorizing facts and numbers. She wanted to learn "
"everything she could find out about the once-great Saxhleel civilization "
"that existed before Duskfall. In this matter, she was an individual, much "
"more independent and more free-thinking than the rest of her egg-siblings. "
"In some ways, her fiery individualism frightened me.\n"
"\n"
"I guess the Hist saw the same things that I noticed, for when she licked the "
"Hist on our Naming Day, she was awarded with the name \"\"Keshu,\"\" which "
"literally means \"\"Stands Apart.\"\" It was a strong name, a good name. The "
"name of a crocodile in a lake of shap. Keshu accepted the name with dignity "
"and honor. It fit her well.\n"
"\n"
"To demonstrate that Keshu wasn't all dull history and fighting, let me tell "
"you about an event from our early childhood. The egg-tender Julan-Nah was "
"forever scolding us and driving us from the Xal-Uxith, the Sacred Nest, even "
"though Keshu loved to play among the developing eggs. To teach the egg-"
"tender a lesson, Keshu tracked and captured a young wamasu. She released it "
"into the nest, assuming it would scare the egg-tender and provide us all "
"with a good laugh. It did the trick, all right, but it also cracked three "
"innocent and helpless eggs. Keshu was so mortified by the damage she had "
"caused that she volunteered to assist the egg-tender for the entire cycle of "
"the calendar.\n"
"\n"
"Near the end of that cycle, the raj-deelith (literally, the elder teacher), "
"Drameencin, arrived to instruct us in preparation for our rites of maturity. "
"It was during this intensive period of lessons and training that Keshu's "
"companions gathered around her. In addition to myself, Keshu attracted the "
"attention of the powerful Vos-Huruk, the sly Tee-Wan, and the clever Xocin. "
"Vos-Huruk was a mountain of a woman who was almost Keshu's equal in battle. "
"Tee-Wan would develop into a thief and a spy. Xocin, on the other hand, "
"enjoyed mixing alchemical tinctures and would go on to become a powerful "
"mage. All would follow Keshu to war. All except me.\n"
"\n"
"Throughout that season, our friendships deepened and Drameencin did "
"everything in his power to prepare us for our maturity rites. But that is "
"another tale entirely."
