"without hesitation. They espouse bravery, yet run away when confronted with "
"justice. They curry favor by giving trinkets to the poor. Then they claim to "
"be benefactors when stealing from those of privilege. A thief is still a "

"Another bland dinner. Baked lamb and squash. I guess I shouldn't be "

"think my goats have a more exciting life than I do. Every time I bring them "
"here to the ruins, it's like they're seeing them for the first time. I envy "
"them. But every day is the same for Najan and Adeena. Same meal, same "
"awkward conversation, same tedious love-making. I can't even be angry with "
"her. When I look across the table all I feel is … nothing.\n"
"\n"
"12th First Seed\n"
"\n"
"I can scarcely believe what I've found. One of my smaller goats, Husul, ran "
"off while I was kicking dung off my sandal. I gave chase and found he had "
"scrambled down into a vault beneath the ruins. It's dark down here, but not "
"so dark that I need a candle to see. These old blue stones glow and hum "
"softly. Even though it's nothing but cold, wet stone, there is something "
"almost inviting about this place. I have decided to call it Husul's Cave. I "
"can't wait to explore it more thoroughly. I already noticed some old books "
"just waiting to be read.\n"
"\n"
"In the meantime, I must go suffer through another flavorless meal with "
"Adeena. She's always asking me if I'm pleased with the food. Offering to "
"wash my clothes. Ruptga help me.\n"
"\n"
"16th First Seed\n"
"\n"
"I've found something—something that will change everything. I was leafing "
"through one of the old books I found when I noticed something shimmering "
"stuck in between the leaves. It was a talisman. It appeared simple at first, "
"but when I rubbed away the dirt and grime I saw it was something priceless. \n"
"\n"
"Then an ethereal woman appeared. She was beautiful beyond measure. I could "
"scarcely speak when I saw her, but she was so kind—she simply giggled. A "
"sweet little laugh. It put me at ease long enough for me to introduce myself."
"\n"
"\n"
"Her name is Anexiel. She says she is an ancient spirit of the "
"ruins—something like a saint, I guess. To my mind, she's something far "
"greater than that. Her eyes are like the water in an oasis, and she has a "
"voice like … oh look at me, playing the poet! I cannot deny it—I have fallen "
"in love with this spirit. If only she were flesh and blood … I would make "
"her mine.\n"
"\n"
"18th First Seed\n"
"\n"
"I am in agony. Anexiel is all I've ever wanted. Each day my love for her "
"grows, yet we cannot be together. She remains a wisp of air—tied to these "
"twice-cursed ruins! Oh how she teases me! Dressed in that shimmering silk, "
"tracing her ghostly fingertip down my shoulder. It's all so … intimate. I "
"had to tell her how I felt. She said she needed time to think. I hope I "
"haven't ruined things.\n"
"\n"
"24th First Seed\n"
"\n"
"She loves me! I knew it! Sweet Anexiel finally confessed her love today, but "
"now she is miserable too. Gods help us.\n"
"\n"
"25th First Seed\n"
"\n"
"She has a plan! My sweet Anexiel has been walking the halls of the vault, "
"thinking, for what seems like days. She finally came to me and said that she "
"can become flesh and blood, but she needs a \"\"vessel.\"\" Someone she can "
"step into and live inside. I don't know how it works exactly. All I know is "
"this vessel needs to have some magic in its blood. I started to despair, but "
"then I remembered my wife. My Adeena. She's always had something in her. "
"Something magical. Her mother called it \"\"the gleam.\"\"  Maybe that will "
"be enough. It has to be enough.\n"

"Once there was a shining city, Erokii, and its princess was the radiant "
"Anurraame. She was considered the envy of all the Ayleid nobility for her "
"beauty, grace, and wisdom were unsurpassed.\n"
"\n"
"In time, she was married to the prince of a distant but great city. It was "
"to be an alliance that spread across Tamriel. The prince was renowned for "
"his martial prowess and stubborn honor, but he loved his new bride Anurraame "
"dearly.\n"
"\n"
"For a time, they were happy, or, at least, they seemed so. But as the years "
"wiled away, Anurraame's husband was away more and more, and duty proved a "
"poor substitute for passion. \n"
"\n"
"So it came to pass that Anurraame took a young champion of Erokii for a "
"lover. Strong and gleaming with youthful light and energy, Anurraame's lover "
"gave her what the old, distant prince could not—the thrill of infatuation "
"and friendship.\n"
"\n"
"Anurraame was careful at first to keep her affair a secret, lest she shame "
"her husband. But caught up in passion's capricious winds, she became more "
"and more reckless, and soon her dalliance was discovered.\n"
"\n"
"Spurned and infuriated, Anurraame's husband arrayed his full army before "
"Erokii and laid siege to the city. The princess vowed to face him with "
"fortitude and called on her lover to muster his forces in defense of the "
"city, which he promised he would.\n"
"\n"
"But when the day of battle came, her lover's forces appeared beside her "
"husband's. His undying passion had been subverted by coin.\n"
"\n"
"Desperate and enraged at her lover's betrayal, Anurraame called on the "
"Daedra for help destroying her enemies and defending her city. Mephala "
"answered and commanded Anurraame to pour all her tears into a basin. Mephala "
"then imbued the tears with the power of the princess's hatred for her "
"traitorous lover, hatred which had formed from the potent seed of the "
"princess's love.\n"
"\n"
"The tears, so empowered, hardened into an artifact, the Tear of Anurraame. "
"When the time of battle came, Anurraame took the artifact to the highest "
"tower of the city and as the armies raged outside the city's walls, she "
"unleashed its power, destroying the armies and the city in the flash of an "
"eye.\n"
"\n"
"All that remains of Erokii, and of Anurraame herself, is a ruined crypt, but "
"there have been whispers throughout the ages that the Tear was not "
"destroyed, and that it's waiting in the rubble, still to be found."
