"the gift of precision in speech and writing. It is a worse mistake, but all "
"too common among Tamrielic Men and Mer, to regard Khajiiti civilization as "

"Much like the Pellitine dagger, the swords of southern Elsweyr evince the "

"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Most Coldsnap bodywear is an amalgam of scrap hide, with layering being the "
"main method of increasing protection, though bone ribbing and splints aren't "
"uncommon. Bear, ogre, and troll fur are often used for warmth.\n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"Daggers were the first legitimate attempt by the Coldsnap to shape metal "
"themselves. While they had not yet developed a method for smelting, the "
"tribe began fusing scrap together in open fires and beating it into a rough "
"blade form.\n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Bracers are almost ubiquitous among the Coldsnap and range from simple wraps "
"of fur to bone and metal reinforced hide. Gloves are almost non-existent, "
"apart from durzog handlers whose thick hide gauntlets are plated along the "
"wrists and fingers.\n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Prior to Dwarven influence, helmets were either hide or bone, with a troll "
"crest being most prized. After recognizing the superiority of metal, "
"however, the Goblins now widely employ a horned skullcap reminiscent of a "
"troll. A sign of the tribe's superiority over their rivals.\n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"In the frigid conditions they live in, pants are a luxury reserved for "
"Goblins of higher station, warriors mostly. Lesser drudges are expected to "
"make do with simple skirts. I believe this is also a method of population "
"control, as strong warriors are often the only Goblins in any condition to "
"mate.\n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"Mostly unchanged in the tribe's post-Dwarven period, blunt weapons remain "
"entirely made from the leg bones of ogres. Some might consider this proof of "
"their primitive nature, but I recognize that the clever Coldsnap won't waste "
"their limited resources when they already have a perfectly effective tool.\n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Shields are where the Coldsnap's ingenuity really comes to the fore. Though "
"the tribe still lacks the understanding to work Dwarven metals, they have "
"begun to embed animunculus scrap into layers of baser metals greatly "
"increasing the strength of their defense.\n"
"\n"
"SHOULDERS\n"
"\n"
"Usually a hide base, reinforced with metal and sometimes adorned with fur. "
"Coldsnap warriors often display the teeth and horns of their most fearsome "
"foes on their shoulders to give themselves a more frightening silhouette.\n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"The Coldsnap mystics have replaced the fir branches of their staves with "
"salvaged rods found in the Frostvault, though they have retained the animal "
"skull fetishes. It's unclear to me if the Dwarven metal has improved their "
"magical abilities, but they break bones quite readily.\n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"As the Coldsnap craftsmen's confidence grew, so did the size of their works, "
"a natural extension of their experimenting with daggers and knives. Though "
"unwieldy, the fused metal swords of the tribe are incredibly solid and "
"surprisingly sharp."

"sashes sometimes adorned with gold chains, rings, or colorful cord. Warriors "
"would employ sturdier reptile hide belts over these sashes as an anchor for "
"arms and armor. Emblems, worn at what would be our navel, often bore Sithis "
"iconography.\n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Elder Argonians used more footwear than many modern tribes, though they "
"still favored open designs that allowed them to keep their feet immersed. "
"Rubber-soled sandals were uniform among all walks of life, though fringed "
"leg wraps, anklets, and shin guards were frequent accompaniments for those "
"of high status.\n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"We still know little about the elder Argonians' relationship with the Hist, "
"but I believe that the bows we've recovered were made from Hist wood. "
"Perhaps they regarded the arrow as an extension of the Hist's will, like "
"some fatal decree, though it might have been just the most readily available "
"source of wood.  \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Elder Argonians preferred light sashes and wraps over tunics. This might "
"have been to keep their frills and spines uncovered for communication. Armor "
"was almost entirely constructed from bronze splints and mostly covered the "
"shoulders and abdomen, suggesting that their own scales were expected to "
"protect the exposed flanks and back.\n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"Regardless of length, elder Argonian blades were made from a series of "
"volcanic glass shards set in a beaten bronze channel. The prevalence of "
"volcanic glass in so many weapons was quite surprising, given that there "
"isn't any known volcanic activity within Black Marsh itself. That suggests "
"the Argonians may have regularly ventured into what we now call Morrowind.\n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Much like their descendants, elder Argonians found gloves impractical. They "
"either used a fingerless mitt that hooked upon the thumb, or hand wraps like "
"those favored by pit fighters. Cloth or leather bracers were commonly worn "
"for decoration and protection, some of the latter mounting rigid metal "
"splints for war. Frilled bands around upper arms were also nearly universal "
"adornments.\n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"A simple circlet or headband acted as the base upon which many styles of "
"headwear could be built. Most had prominent ornamentation above the face and "
"employed feather plumes, jewels, and great brass icons as decoration. "
"Impractical as it may seem, these headdresses were even worn into battle "
"over leather hoods.\n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Where a simple loincloth is one of the more widely preferred pieces of "
"legwear among tribal Argonians now, their ancestors swaddled themselves in "
"elaborate layers. Knee- and ankle-length skirts and pants were often layered "
"with other frilled skirts and dangling drapery. Warriors favored a top layer "
"of rigid leather or woven reeds reinforced by bronze and bone.\n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"War bludgeons we recovered from a sunken foundry were impressive. Made "
"largely of bronze, these weapons must have been wielded by warriors of great "
"stature. Though it is the striking ends that are the most interesting "
"features. Usually styled after Argonian heads, the designs were "
"angular—almost geometric—and familiar, as was the metal it was cast from. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Maybe it was the way the glass teeth along the rim reminded me of a cog, or "
"the orange tinge of the shield's face, or the boxy scrollwork, but the "
"answer to the nagging familiarity I felt with elder Argonian metalwork "
"struck me like one of their maces: Dwarven influence. Black Marsh may not "
"always have been as insular a province as it is these days.\n"
"\n"
"SHOULDERS\n"
"\n"
"Usually a combination of leather and bronze, shoulder guards consisted of "
"nothing more than a simple curved pad and a strap to loop through the pit of "
"the arm. Rather than being shaped to fit over the shoulder, many simply "
"projected upward—some as high as the wearer's jaw, making them something of "
"a neck-guard as well. \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Staves were primarily instruments of the priesthood of Sithis. Many of these "
"bronze rods were capped with icons and symbols of the Great Serpent to whom "
"the priests made their sacrifices, but some bore razor-sharp, glass teeth "
"intended to spill blood in many of their ceremonies. All evidence points "
"toward Sithis playing a more central role in ancient Argonian worship than "
"in modern day, at least among most tribes.\n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"We didn't understand why volcanic glass was preferred for blades when the "
"ancient Argonians already possessed the capacity for metalwork. In testing "
"one of the glass swords, we quickly learned that the brutal sharpness was "
"frightening for as long as the glass remained intact. It's also easy to "
"replace in the field and lighter than metal sharpening equipment."

"By Bolu, Reel-Ka of the Dead-Water Tribe\n"
"\n"
"My quill will write the truth words. Dead-Water warriors defend the tribe in "
"both life and death. Many travelers find this tradition morbid. They speak "
"of defiling our fallen kin. It is not so. To craft a weapon from the skin "
"and bones of our warriors, this is honoring.\n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"A proper axe requires a leg bone. This, the Dead-Water know. It is the only "
"bone long and thick enough to support the axe head. Male bones are best for "
"this because of their thickness. Female bones are too flexible, better "
"suited for blades. By wielding this axe with strength, we honor a fallen "
"warrior.\n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"Dead-Water Tribe is not renowned for beautiful creations. This is known. "
"Still, our leatherworkers decorate the belts of our warriors. They carve "
"intricate buckles from amber and stone. I nod in admittance. This is not "
"necessary, but still, it is nice.\n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"The mightiest Dead-Water warriors line their boots with sharp spikes. Useful "
"in close combat. With every kick, we hope to pierce the hide of our foes. My "
"egg-mother was able to behead her enemies with one swift kick. This is why I "
"carry her bones in my weapons. I hope to carry her fighting spirit.\n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Dead-Water quivers are made from the hardened hide of our fallen. Our bows "
"are lined with their fangs, and our arrowheads created from their bones. "
"After battle, we will salvage what arrows we can. Many will keep broken "
"arrowheads in remembrance.\n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"The Dead-Water bound our warrior hearts in the skin of our fallen. Atop "
"this, we wear hardened scales from lurking beasts: haj mota, wamasu, "
"hackwing. Our hunters have slayed, our leatherworkers have skinned. And now "
"our warriors proudly wear.\n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"Dead-Water daggers are made from bones of the arm or shin. When finally the "
"blade wears, they are used for eating. I regularly eat with a dagger made "
"from the shin of my egg-sire's egg-sire. He has lasted through many seasons. "
"I do not share this with travelers I meet. They do not understand such "
"things.\n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"I flex my hands. Gloves must be supple. I look upon the metal hands of "
"outsiders with questioning. A Dead-Water warrior must strike quickly. And, "
"should all else fail, we will use our claws to rip and tear. To cover our "
"fingers would be to take away such weapons.\n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"I bow my head, displaying a helmet covered in long horns. It strikes fear "
"into the heart of my foes. Dead-Water warriors must always be prepared for "
"battle. So we place horns upon our helmets. This way, we continually display "
"the spine of aggression. A display that all of Murkmire knows to fear.\n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"To the front, hardened scale. Behind, supple leather. Dead-Water leg greaves "
"allow for quick movement during battle. Useful in a swamp where the land "
"itself will swallow you whole. This also enables quiet movement. Useful for "
"sneaking towards our enemies. Again, I eye the metal of travelers with "
"distrust. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"Dead-Water maces have rounded, curved edges. This was not always so. In my "
"egg-mother's time, skulls were used. They proved far too brittle. Now we "
"place sharp bones atop the heads. Still we honor our ancestors, but now the "
"maces are more durable for battle.\n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Dead-Water warriors protect in life and death. Their spirits have returned "
"to the Hist. Flesh and bone remain to aid us in battle. I bow my head in "
"respect. We show this most clearly with our shields. The skin of our fallen "
"are stretched across the wood. Their bones decorate the sides.\n"
"\n"
"SHOULDERS\n"
"\n"
"Our shoulders proudly display spikes of bone. Should the wamasu try to crush "
"us? Should our foes crash against us? The Dead-Water will drop their "
"shoulders, bringing them up for a mighty blow. With skill, a bone will crack "
"or sinew will tear. I will confess, such spikes also add awe to the look of "
"our armor.  \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Dead-Water staff is as dangerous as our blades. Its amber gem is soaked in "
"the sap of the Hist. From this, its power is absorbed. Only the bones of our "
"fallen mages will create such weapons. By this, they lend their magical "
"essence to another. Or so it is believed.\n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"Dead-Water swords are only held by our most cunning of warriors. Its jagged "
"back can easily cut its wielder, should they not be careful. I bow in "
"reverence. My blade is a most prized possession. Crafted from the leg bone "
"of my egg-mother. Even still she fights by my side."

"\n"

"\n"
"The footwear of the Order of the Silver Dawn are always warriors' sabatons "

"as they put the boot into wounded lycanthropes. \"\"That's right!\"\" we "
"shout. \"\"Give it another!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"The elegant bows of our Silver Dawn archers send their winged darts arcing "
"into the pelts and soft underbellies of the horrid abominations we are sworn "
"to slay. Our greatest archer, the legendary Sir Brancas, once drove his "
"arrows through the eyes of nine werewolves in succession. Oh, to have been "
"there to see it! \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"The Silver Dawn cuirass is constructed of overlapping bands of heavy "
"leather, thick but flexible, for we must be nimble when contending with our "
"fierce and feral enemies. Woe betide the werewolf who tries his teeth on the "
"boiled leather of a Silver Dawn chest piece!\n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"A Silver Dawn's dagger is a short but sturdy stabbing blade with two edges "
"and a silvered crosspiece for parrying. A warrior keeps one always at their "
"belt for delivering the coup de grace to a mortally wounded man-"
"beast—usually right in its abominable guts! \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Many martial traditions prefer gauntlets that protect the hand and forearm "
"but leave the fingers and thumb bare, the better to grip their weaponry—but "
"their opponents aren't lycanthropes, whose bite brings a curse. For this "
"reason all Silver Dawn gauntlets are full-fingered, even with light armor, "
"as we dare not fight with bare skin exposed. \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"In most cases we Silver Dawn stalwarts wear helms that cover the entire "
"head, for the same reason we wear full gauntlets: we dare not show exposed "

"tough, boiled leather—werewolf hide, if we can get enough of it!\n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Werewolves: it's always said that they go for the throat, but we who fight "
"them know they're just as likely to target the legs, as that's how their "
"wild cousins bring down their prey. And that's why we spare no expense on "
"Silver Dawn greaves, making them strong, durable, and of overlapping layers. "
"\n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"A Silver Dawn's mace is a thing of terrible beauty, topped with a heavy "
"brazen ball studded with two dozen silvered spikes. As you can imagine, a "
"werewolf's skull that has been battered with one of these lovelies is barely "
"recognizable!\n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Silver Dawn shields are tall, oblong affairs crafted of durable hardwood, "
"thin but dense, and all but impervious to the claws and fangs of our "
"atrocious opponents, may the Divines ever aid us in striking them down! From "
"behind these shields we hammer those bestial monsters with abandon. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"To strike fear into the cowardly hearts of our wicked foes, the Silver Dawn "
"warriors wear on their shoulders, not stiff pauldrons or shoulder cops, but "
"instead the pelts and severed heads of wolves and man-wolves, their eyes "
"replaced by silver spheres. For by the gleam of silver shall we slay!\n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"A Silver Dawn spell staff is surmounted with golden wings of victory "
"unfurled around a finial bearing the silvered image of a severed wolf's-head."
" How I love to watch one of our staves glow with refulgent death before "
"spitting its message of destruction at some wretched lycanthrope!\n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"The swords of the Order of the Silver Dawn are straight, strong, and double-"
"edged, like the pack-slaughtering knights who wield them. There's nothing "
"like watching a howling man-beast go down under the flashing blades of half "
"a dozen Silver Dawn warriors. Glorious!"

"nimble to avoid a beast's fangs and talons, or a mortal's dagger and glaive. "
"\n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"The large hunting knives of Hircine's Hounds serve many purposes, of which "
"\"\"weapon\"\" is only one: skinning knife, pointer-of-stakes, and trimmer "
"of net cords are among the others. The blade has but a single edge, but it's "
"forged of heavy steel and balanced for both chopping and thrusting. It's a "
"clever tool, and thus dedicated to Gulibeg the Quick Fox. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Leather vambraces protect the Hunstsman's forearms, extending down even over "
"the back of the hands, but fingered gloves are never worn. For does Gulibeg "
"the Quick Fox wreathe his wise and wandering fingers in swaddles of fabric? "
"Never! \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Affixed to their stiff skullcaps of boiled leather, Huntsmen wear the "
"antlers and horns of fallen Prey, for who should respect the Hunted more "
"than the Hunter? And when we wear beast's clothing we are akin to Storihbeg "
"the Skinshifter, and honor him thereby. Howl again, and stomp your heels "
"like hooves!\n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Is any Daedric Prince more active and more athletic than mighty Lord "
"Hircine? I will answer for you to avoid foolish error: NO! And so his "
"Huntsmen, and we who emulate them, must be quick and nimble, which is why we "
"put little stock in leg armor. Does Uricanbeg the Great Stag armor his legs? "
"No! Does Gulibeg the Quick Fox? …At this point, Uraccanach thinks he can let "
"you answer it yourself. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"The Huntsman's mace is a bone-breaker, its heavy metal head fittingly "
"studded with bone, horn, and antlers. Though it can deliver the coup de "
"grace when needed, it's usually employed to shatter a Prey's leg before it "
"is beheaded with an axe. Wielding the mace calls for strength, for which we "
"pray to Hrokkibeg the Mighty Bear!\n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"The Huntsman's kite-shaped shield is large and of thick boiled hide, nearly "
"as strong as metal but much lighter. It bears the antlered visage of "
"Uricanbeg the Great Stag, and is surmounted and bordered with actual stag "
"antlers, lashed to the shield with strips of hart leather. Beat your weapon "
"against it to drum like the Great Stag's hooves! \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"Though Huntsmen in general favor relatively light armor choices, there is no "
"harm in a good pair of pauldrons—I tell you this as a Witchman from five "
"generations of Witchmen! Pauldrons, they are all right. And they give us one "
"more place to wear horns and spikes, so that is all to the good. \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Our spellcasters' staves are topped with the skull-and-antlers totem of "
"Uricanbeg, Lord Hircine's aspect of the Great Stag. Rows of focusing claws "
"line both the staff's lower head and the base of its haft, for as "
"Destruction magic is cast from the front end, so Restoration is cast from "
"the hind.     \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes the Prey requires a coup de grace of a thrust to the heart rather "
"than a beheading, and for that task the Huntsman uses the sword. Though the "
"Huntsman's blade is forged of the finest available steel, crossguard and "
"haft are of claws and leather-wrapped bone, more serviceable than ornamental."

"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Dremora sabatons are tough and soled with thick treads, for we stride the "
"surfaces of worlds uncounted, regardless of the ruggedness of their terrain. "
"Our toes and arches are protected by shields of filigreed dark-metal, but "
"our boots' insteps and uppers are of finest Argonian hide—a lesson learned "
"on Nirn, for not all mortal ideas should be disdained.  \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"The Coldharbour Dremora's bow is a composite weapon assembled from horn from "
"various sources, including the prongs and spurs of our own honored dead. "
"Quivers are adorned with motifs that evoke the Prince of Domination. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Our many-layered dark-metal cuirasses are embossed with the swirling "

"before it is hardened into martial permanence by the sheer willpower of the "
"Daedra. Thus we honor the Prince of Domination, who makes every reality "
"submit to his insatiable desires.  \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"The daggers of Coldharbour Dremora have triangular blades designed for both "
"parrying and punch-stabbing, leaving wounds that close poorly in the flesh "
"of mortals unless they are particularly skilled with Restoration magic. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"We wear the gauntlets of warriors, battle gloves of mortalhide under curved "
"plates and lames of metal, all embossed with symbols of chaotic creatia, to "
"protect our forearms and weapon-gripping hands from the ill-aimed blows of "
"our pathetic opponents. Dread Lord, with these we raise our fists to salute "
"you! \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"

"Domination. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Greaves of grievance, we craft our cuisses from the tanned skins of our "
"defeated foes, defending our hides with the hides that did not defend them. "
"Fine-worked poleyns protect our knees, not for kneeling in submission, but "
"to enhance sudden, vicious blows in close combat. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"The mace, of course, is the symbol of our Dread Lord Molag Bal, and so the "
"martial mace of the Coldharbour Dremora must pay homage to that symbol "
"without crossing the line into blasphemous imitation. Therefore, follow our "
"guidelines without deviation, kynworms!  \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Dremora shields are of heavy metal, for we are strong, and replete with "
"sharp points, for we are dangerous. Embossed symbols depict the flow of "
"chaotic creatia as it appears before Daedric will imposes order upon it. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"The Xivilai think our flaring and pointed pauldrons are ostentatious and "
"extreme—and they're right, for thus do we achieve the distinctive angular "
"silhouette that evokes the concept of \"\"skeir-gallyn,\"\" or "
"discorporation-by-geometry. For what is a Dremora if not a belligerent "
"collision of acute hyper-angles? \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"As proud servants of the Prince of Domination, the heads of our "
"spellcasters' staves symbolically evoke our Dread Lord's ridged horns, with "

"haft ends in a point like a curved metal talon.    \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"If, as you were trained, you impale our enemies so that they die slowly, "
"their long final moments will be spent staring in horrified disbelief at the "
"intricate scrollwork on your sword's upper tang and crossbar. It behooves "
"you to follow our forging designs closely so that our Dread Lord will be "
"honored by his enemies' dying contemplations."

"AXES\n"
"\n"
"Pyandonean axes are double-bladed, even the one-handed weapons, great edged "
"crescents like the wings of rays. They sport a shell motif where the tang "
"goes into the haft, which features an edged and pointed ferrule at its base. "
"For their size, the weapons are marvelously light, a hallmark of Sea Elf "
"design. \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"Pyandonean belts are made of the same thick, overlapping leather strips as "
"their light and medium armor, and made from the same source: triple-tanned "
"hide of porpoise, creatures the Sea Elves slaughter on sight out of sheer "
"hatred for the blissful creatures' exuberance and joy.  \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"In line with the Pyandoneans' obsession with survivability should they end "
"up in the water, their boots are light affairs made of (what else?) porpoise "
"hide, and easily kicked off before they can drag their wounded wearers down "
"into the depths. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Sea Elf bows are at core simple self bows of Pyandonean yew, though they are "
"often elaborately decorated with sculpted sea serpents wrapping the bow's "
"limbs above and below the grip. Their quivers are fanciful, shaped like "
"great barbed fins, the arrows fletched with seabird plumage. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"The armored area of Pyandonean chest pieces is largely confined to "
"protecting the chest, back, and abdomen, with the arms left lightly covered "
"or free to enable swimming. (Note to self: do the Sea Elves have a "
"particular fear of drowning? Worth researching.) Light and medium armor are "
"of overlapping strips of porpoise leather, but heavy armor is of orgnium.  \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"Pyandonean daggers exhibit the same scimitar-like curve as their swords, "
"with a barbed hook behind the point that the Sea Elves use to wicked effect "
"in close combat. The cross-guards at the hilt are forged in the shape of the "
"heads of sea serpents, and can be used to trap and even break a blade in "
"parrying.     \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Gloves inhibit both swimming and climbing in ships' rigging, so they are not "
"popular among the Pyandoneans, whose gauntlets consist mostly of bracers to "
"protect their wearers' forearms.   \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Like their boots, a key aspect of Pyandonean headgear is that it's easily "
"doffed in the event the wearer goes overboard. The light armor coifs are "
"just hoods, but the medium and heavy helms seem intended to intimidate by "
"presenting a nonhuman visage, either some sort of crustacean or a spiny deep-"
"sea predator.  \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Though their outfits are usually kilted, underneath them the Pyandonean "
"marine wears greaves of overlapping porpoise leather, tightly wound so as "
"not to interfere with swimming or the climbing of ships' rigging. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"In line with the idea that Pyandonean marines' gear shouldn't be heavy "
"enough to drag them under if they go overboard, the heads of their maces are "
"relatively light, relying on points and flanges to do damage rather than "
"bludgeoning weight. They're also comparatively short in the haft. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Pyandonean shields are basically kite-shaped, but smaller than most kite-"
"shaped shields, possibly as a way of mitigating their weight. They're forged "
"of a light but durable metal, with radiant shell designs at top and bottom, "
"and usually depicting at center the raised or embossed figure of a sea "
"serpent.\n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"The shell-shaped Pyandonean pauldrons are constructed of stiffened porpoise-"
"leather often capped by a covering of orgnium, the mysterious light metal "
"the Sea Elves use for their heavier arms and armor. Symbols of rank are "
"typically affixed to shoulder armor for the easy identification of officers. "
" \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"The finial on top of a Pyandonean staff is, of course, sculpted in the shape "
"of a sea serpent. Curiously, it's made of orgnium, the same light metal used "
"so extensively in Sea Elven armor. Whether it's imbued with magical "
"properties to assist in the focusing of spells is unknown, but seems likely. "
"\n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"Pyandonean swords are curved like scimitars, but with a dogleg just above "
"the quillion, and a barb behind the point that enables the weapon to be used "
"somewhat like a boathook, snagging enemies and dragging them overboard or "
"into off-hand thrusts. They are ornamented rather simply except for the "
"quillions, which take the shape of a two-headed looping sea serpent."

"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"While in principle the ideal material for our Fang Lair belts would be "
"tanned human skin, in practice human-hide just isn't thick or durable enough "
"for our needs, so you may substitute cattle or horse-hide leather. A skull-"
"shaped belt buckle will get our point across just as well.  \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Our experience among the narrow-minded of Tamriel has taught us to be quick "
"on our feet and ready to relocate, so our shoes are a relatively light "
"element of our apparel. They may even be as simple as sandals, especially "
"when paired with light armor.  \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Any style with \"\"Fang\"\" in its name implies it will look sharp and "
"dangerous, and that's certainly the case with our Blackmarrow bows. Even the "
"quivers that carry our broad-headed arrows are adorned with sharp motifs and "
"even sharper edges. (Wear gloves when arming yourselves, fools.) \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Though we haven't been able to provide them yet for every member, eventually "
"all of you will proudly wear our Fang Lair tattoos and body markings. These "
"marks are a tribute to your fervent commitment to the Blackmarrow cause, and "
"to show them off our cuirasses leave the less-critical parts of your torsos "
"exposed.  \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"Like much of our equipment, our daggers derive from proven Redguard designs: "
"curved, single-edged blades, sharp pointed, and with our signature "
"\"\"fang\"\" in the barbed hook behind the point.  \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"You will agree—for you must—that for both conjuring and combat, it's best to "
"have the fingers free of the confinement of cumbersome gloves; however, "
"above the hands you can trust our flaring gauntlets to protect the wrists "
"and forearms.  \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"The Blackmarrow wear close-fitting metal skullcaps with upper-face visors "
"covered by tight-turbaned hoods that extend to our shoulders. If you are "
"wise, you will wear an additional mail coif under the hood to protect your "
"neck. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"We rely on leather, supple but many-layered, to protect our legs. Our "
"fighting style dictates the primacy of mobility, in which attacks to the "
"legs are mainly avoided or turned aside before a blade can ever contact our "
"greaves or chausses. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"A mace is the preferred weapon for an order with necromantic ambitions, "
"because a body struck down by a mace is more useful for reanimation than a "
"corpse with severed limbs. Thus our maces are heavy and functional, so that "
"you may defeat an adversary with the least number of blows, leaving behind a "
"body ripe for necromancy.     \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"The broad oval shield of the Blackmarrow, rimmed with overlapping metal "
"plates, has one purpose and one purpose only: to protect your body in combat."
" Those who fail to employ it properly may, upon death, be reanimated and "
"assigned to menial and even humiliating tasks. So use it wisely. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"The symbolism behind crafting our pauldrons to resemble grinning abstract "
"metallic skulls should be obvious to even our least-sophisticated cult "
"members. Remember: in Necromancy, there are no points for subtlety.   \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"The focal finial of our spellcasters' magic staves features a mystic "
"crescent between two bony, taloned fingers. It has been pointed out to me "
"that this symbology appears nowhere else on our gear, but as a Master "
"Necromancer I am above such a small-minded emphasis on consistency. It looks "
"impressive, and that's good enough.     \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"Our swords fundamentally hearken back to Redguard roots, though the austere "
"descendants of the Ansei would shy away from the baroque and spiky "
"improvements we've made to their overly simple designs. The fools! Soon, "
"they, too, will acknowledge our greatness and kneel before us."
