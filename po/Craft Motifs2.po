"\n"
"Take a pair of Nord boots, you know the kind: simple, but thick and sturdy. "
"Leave them next to your stove or forge for a month, making sure to spray "
"them with water once or twice a day. When the metal is spotted with rust, "
"and the leather is cracked and flaking, you're done. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"How Draugr bows maintain their flexibility and functionality after rotting "
"in a vault for a thousand years is a mystery, even to me—but they work just "
"fine, and I've got the arrow-scars to prove it. However, if you don't want "
"your \"\"new\"\" Draugr bow to snap in half when you draw it, I advise using "
"fresh materials. Just antique it appropriately for that musty from-the-"
"catacombs look.   \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Get one of those Nord cuirasses that shows a lot of skin, the kind that "
"says, \"\"I'm too tough to care about the weather.\"\" Then weather it: dry "
"out the leather, spot the steel with rust, rip chunks out of any fur, and "
"finally scar up every visible surface with a chisel. There you have it: "
"authentic Draugr armor! \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"Why does a Draugr dagger look so creepy? I mean, it's just an ancient Nord "
"fighting knife that's been buried with an undead warrior for a millennium. "
"If you want the same look for your dagger, you can't go wrong with rust "
"spots and spider webs. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Acquire a pair of medium-grade Nord gauntlets, with good coverage of the "
"lower forearms. Then Draugr-ize them by tying them to a cord and dragging "
"them behind your mount for a few weeks.  \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Don't get mere helmets, get full Nord helms that cover the entire head, and "
"ideally have prominent horns. Don't skimp on this: the horned helm is very "
"important to achieving that classic Draugr silhouette. Scar the leather "
"parts with a cleaver, ding up the metal with a hammer, and rub rust and "
"grave dirt into every surface.  \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Start with a pair of basic cylindrical greaves of Nord design, then "
"\"\"Draugr them up\"\" by burying them in a dung heap for two weeks. You can "
"add verisimilitude by nicking them with a chisel if you like, but after the "
"dung treatment nobody's really going to look at them all that closely.   \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"A Draugr's mace may look old and rickety, but I assure you, it's strong, "
"solid, and will crush your skull in a heartbeat if you're careless. Make "
"sure your Draugr warhammer is made of sturdy materials underneath its "
"coating of dust, rust, and cobwebs. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"The ancient Nords bore large shields, and so do their revenants. Use modern "
"oak and steel, but craft your Draugr shield to an old pattern, then use a "
"heavy axe to nick its face and edges as if it's survived a hundred battles. "
"I use a heavy lumberjack's tool for this purpose—no points for subtlety! \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"Take a pair of classic Nord shield-shaped pauldrons, and then abuse them by "
"tying them to the rim of a servant's wagon wheel for a week. Your servants "
"may complain that this makes the wagon's ride intolerably bumpy, but just "
"tell them you're following Narsis Dren's advice. That will silence them!  \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Draugr revenants schooled in \"\"the clever art\"\" don't cast a lot of "
"happy healing and light spells, so for authenticity, make sure your Draugr "
"staff has a dark and sinister look to it. You can't go wrong with dried "
"bloodstains on the head and haft, in my experience. \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"The ancient Nords liked their swords large and heavy enough to kill at a "
"single blow, so avoid light, dueling-style blades for your Draugr-style "
"swords. And no matter how nicked and dented it is, your sword's edge should "
"still be razor-sharp."

"Assassins League Style\n"
"By the Gray Maybe\n"
"\n"
"The \"\"Dark Brotherhood\"\"? Utter nonsense. The Brotherhood is a myth. A "
"legend. A lie. Death comes to us all, and murder is merely a matter of "
"mundane craft—there's no need to invoke the Void, or its, ahem, mother. \n"
"\n"
"Ah, but a secret society of assassins, a guild of killers for hire—now that "
"makes sense. That's just good business. And like every good business, we "
"have standards. You wish to join us, and dress like one of our league? Then "
"follow the instructions below. And one day, if you are found worthy, you may "
"be invited to learn some actual secrets. \n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"The hallmark of Assassins' weapons is that they are both nimble and "
"effective, striving for that sweet spot between the heavy arms of soldiers "
"and the supple but over-subtle weapons of duelists. Our axes, for example, "
"feature a single, broad blade, with no more than a short slicing crescent on "
"the backside for ripostes. \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"You'll notice that all Assassins wear dual belts, one above the other, with "
"weapons and tassets depending from the lower strap. Why is that? Because "
"sometimes a job goes wrong and you need to make a sudden escape, in which "
"case you can drop the bottom belt and everything on it, losing all that "
"extra encumbrance. \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Boots? An Assassin's footwear will be more like a dancer's shoes than a "
"warrior's sabatons: light, flexible, and above all quiet. The best leather "
"for soles is guar hide, which is limber but provides good traction on "
"uncertain surfaces. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"If someone should say unto you, \"\"Oh, I see your bow has death's-heads on "
"it, so I guess I should be really afraid, since you must be some kind of "
"assassin or something, right?\"\" …You are authorized by the League to kill "
"such a person, and take their head. Full-sized skulls make good decorations "
"for ballistas.   \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Remember, Assassin, you are not a soldier—it may be your job to kill, but "
"wholesale slaughter is not your task: you kill once, and escape to kill "
"again. So League-standard armor, even your cuirass, is to be relatively "
"lightweight and flexible, with plenty of attach-points for tools and weapons."
" \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"For the League Assassin, the primary function of the dagger is as a weapon "
"for surprise attack from behind, to either slice the windpipe or plunge into "
"the lower back. It must be small enough to be nimble but big enough to kill, "
"and razor-sharp on both edge and point. A barb behind the point comes in "
"handy when manipulating a body, whether living or dead. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Keeping your hands nimble and free is of critical importance in all phases "
"of assassination. When lightly armored, we forego gloves entirely below the "
"forearm; even when more heavily armored, our gloves are so light and supple "
"as to be barely there at all.  \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Executioners don't wear helmets, they wear hoods—and so do we. To be quite "
"accurate, we wear leather coifs, layered underneath, in the heavier "
"versions, with skullcaps and flexible mail. The value of a buffe that "
"conceals the lower features is obvious in our profession. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"As often as not, a League Assassin travels on all four limbs, leaping and "
"climbing, clambering and crawling. For such activities, rigid greaves are a "
"liability, so with leg armor, as elsewhere, the watchwords are resilience "
"and ease of motion. Modest knee poleyns are useful when crawling or kneeling "
"to shoot.   \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"For bludgeoning, we use a square-headed warhammer backed with a metal spike "
"deliberately curved to evoke the look of a raptor's talon. It's also useful "
"for prying open any doors or windows you might encounter between you and "
"your target.   \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"For the League, a shield usually comes into play on two-person missions, "
"where one assassin is using it to cover a second killer who's picking a lock "
"or lining up a shot. So the shield must be large enough to crouch behind, "
"but with cutouts to left and right so one can stab or shoot around it. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"While flaring pauldrons may make a fashionable silhouette for a warrior, "
"they are counterproductive for an Assassin, who can't risk getting hung up "
"in the scenery in the middle of a stalk. Shoulder protection is important, "
"but so is keeping a low profile. \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"When we assign an Assassin a target, we say, \"\"Pass over them with the "
"Hand of Death.\"\" Thus we use a stylized iron hand as the finial on our "
"spellcasters' magic staves. It is acceptable to place a round-cut precious "
"stone on the back of the hand to represent the all-seeing eye of the League. "
"\n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"A League Assassin's sword is a tool of death, long and strong, sharp-edged "
"and sharp-pointed, with a barb behind the tip of the slightly-curving blade. "
"It designed to be fearsome to behold, its very look calculated to paralyze "
"an opponent who sees it come gleaming from the shadows."

"Ebony helms resemble those worn by Dremora, with full visors, crests, and "
"flaring wing-shaped prongs over the ears. The eye-slits are narrow and "
"deliberately sinister in aspect.  \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"The greaves are constructed to the same design as the rest of the armor set, "
"with overlapping chevron-shaped plates, and shield-shaped poleyns at the "
"knees.  \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"The Ebony warhammer is a decidedly nasty affair, with a heavy flanged head "
"and a curved back spike. The haft is partly sheathed in metal for parrying "
"purposes, while the ferrule sports the same curved spike seen on the bottom "
"of the axe handles.   \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"The Ebony shield clearly shows the armor set's mixed stylistic heritage: "
"though kite-shaped like a heavy Nord shield, its bulbous central forms "
"resemble Dunmeri bug-armor, all inscribed with unknown runes that look like "
"Daedric script—but aren't. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"The pauldrons on Ebony armor are sharp and shield-shaped, with an extra "
"chevron-shaped plate flaring out over the upper arms. There is a layer of "
"thick leather, or even chainmail, beneath the over-plates.  \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Compared to the ornate detailing on the armor, Ebony spell staves are "
"relatively simple in design, consisting of a shaft of dark hardwood, "
"sheathed in metal toward the top, with a finial of down-flaring crescent "
"wings. The ferrule is equipped with the same curved spike as other hafted "
"Ebony weapons. \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"Ebony-style swords are definitely Daedric in inspiration, with crinkled, "
"asymmetrical handles topped by twisted guards, from which sprout single-"
"edged blades with disturbing curves. The sides of the blades are etched with "
"runes that, though traditional to the Ebony style, are of unknown origin."

"By Kari Coin-Counter\n"
"\n"
"Do you know what's a good way to waste money? …Actually, you probably know a "
"lot of ways to waste money. Let me rephrase that: do you know a good way to "
"save money? I'll tell you—buy in bulk, and have any manufactured goods made "
"to specific standards. Economy: that's the reason Thieves Guild arms and "
"armor need to follow the specifications below. \n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"Thieves Guild axes are sturdy, made to open up both armored opponents and "
"reluctant doors. Also, note the way our axes have hooked blades so they can "
"act as prying tools when necessary. The Guild triple-dagger symbol appears "
"in the center of the head. \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"Actually, the Guild is not all that finicky about belts, so long as they're "
"strong and made of top-grain hide, whether from cattle, welwa, or kagouti. "
"Design of the metal buckle is less important than the fact that it shouldn't "
"be shiny.   \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Guild boots should be of sturdy leather, with stiff uppers but soft and "
"flexible soles. Get a pair from the supplier and test them yourself: if they "
"creak or rustle when you walk, they're not suitable for the Thieves Guild. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"A Thieves Guild bow should be of dense but springy ash or yew, powerful "
"enough to drop a guard at medium range. The front of the limbs should be "
"faced with (dull) metal sheathing for parrying purposes. Arrowheads should "
"be steel, but once again, not shiny: you don't want a glint from your arrow "
"to betray your position as your draw down on your target. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Our cuirasses are constructed of overlapping layers of articulated tooled "
"leather, well-oiled to keep the armor both flexible and silent. Heavier "
"versions will be faced with light steel plates to protect critical areas, "
"but the metal must be matte and dullish. A round boss with the three-bladed "
"Guild symbol is to appear on both chest and upper back. \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"The official Guild dagger is a double-edged stabbing weapon with a broad "
"blade—almost a short sword. The flaring three-bladed Guild symbol at the "
"hilt serves as a crossguard.   \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Thieves Guild gloves may look like warrior's gauntlets above the wrist, but "
"the fingers must be sheathed in soft kid or chamois so as not to interfere "
"with the delicate manipulation so critical to thieving. \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"We're thieves, so we don't wear steel pots on our heads: metal helmets are "
"noisy, shiny, and would impair our vision. We want a nice, flexible, dark "
"leather cowl, with a feature-concealing mask covering the lower half of the "
"face. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Guild greaves are nothing fancy, just gaiters of dark oiled leather with "
"attachment points for dull steel overplates. As with the rest of the armor, "
"they mustn't creak during movement. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"A Thieves Guild warhammer doubles as both weapon and tool: the heavy, flat "
"head is backed with a spike that can also serve as a crowbar. The three-"
"bladed Guild symbol should appear on both sides of the hammer head.  \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Deciding to encumber oneself with a shield can be a difficult decision for a "
"thief, so we allow a fair amount of variation is both shape and size: "
"anything from a medium round shield up to a full kite shield is acceptable. "
"The Guild symbol should appear in the center on a (rather large) round boss. "
"\n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"The fact is, thieves often run away, and when you're running away you tend "
"to get hit on the shoulders. So for us, shoulder armor is not a good place "
"to economize. We want multiple layers of thick, articulated leather on our "
"pauldrons, with buckle points for adding additional layers of non-shiny "
"metal. Don't skimp. \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Thieves Guild spell staves are pretty low profile, of dark hardwood with a "
"finial in the shape of our familiar three-bladed symbol. It's a good idea to "
"add metal prongs to the foot so the staff can help add stability when "
"thieving on uncertain surfaces. \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"A thief doesn't really want to close with an opponent (except by surprise), "
"so our Thieves Guild swords are broad, double-edged affairs made for "
"slashing so as to keep an enemy at bay. As with the daggers, our flaring "
"three-bladed Guild symbol provides a crossguard at the haft."

"\n"
"It was smart to buy out that entire shipment of mix-and-match layered "

"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"When we bought those Satakalaam cuirasses, I got them to throw in two crates "
"of matching gauntlets constructed along similar lines: a sturdy leather base "
"that supports layers of mix-and-match plates mounted on top. Those are good "
"combat gloves; it's almost a shame not to sell them. But the guards must "
"have gauntlets!\n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"We sold the Iron Wheel three crates of those turbaned conical helmets from "
"Gilane. I think we have one crate left, so let's issue those to the Abah's "
"Watch guards. If we run out of the conical helms, give them metal skullcaps "
"to wear under the turbans. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"The greaves we're using follow the same design principle as the gauntlets "
"and cuirass: they're heavy top-grain leather lined with strap-points for "
"buckling on layered metal plates. Leave off the metal plates for the guards "
"working beats on the docks—if they fall in the harbor, we want them to be "
"able to get out again. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"We got the maces from the same forge as the axes and shields, and they have "
"that same double-crescent motif, in this case as the shape of the sharp "
"flanges on the maces' heads. That double crescent: I wonder what it means?  \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Even after equipping the Iron Wheel, we still have a lot of those round "
"shields faced with the double-crescent design. Put a slightly different tint "
"on them and issue those to our guards. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"We have a fair number of sets of pauldrons from Satakalaam that match the "
"cuirass and gauntlets—heavy leather with attachments for overlapping metal "
"plates. In for a copper, in for a drake: might as well give those to the "
"Landing guards as well. \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"In the warehouse at the outer harbor you'll find a round dozen spell-staves "
"topped with double-crescent finials. That ought to be enough to equip our "
"spellcasting officers, and as a bonus they match the design on the axes, "
"maces, and shields.\n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"We got both one-handed and two-handed swords from the school at Leki's "
"Blade, and from their quality and condition you'd never know they'd been "
"used as practice blades by students for years. Redguards take care of their "
"swords like nobody else."

"By Uraccanach the Witchman\n"
"\n"
"Would you live among the wild of the northern woods, and perhaps be wild "
"yourself? Would you worship Hircine in his aspects of Alrabeg the Hunter, or "
"Storihbeg the Skinchanger? Would you seek for the Beast Within, so it may be "
"released to seek its blood prey? Then let your arms and armor bespeak these "
"things of you, for at times your speech may be naught more than a growl. "
"Hearken, Manbeast:\n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"Woodsman you may have been, but though you bear an axe, you are woodsman no "
"more. For you shall turn your axe from hewing wood to spilling blood. Broad "
"shall be the fore-blade, and narrow the hind, but the hind-blade shall sport "
"three claws, that you may scrape the mark of the beast into the flesh of "
"your prey. \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"You shall make your belt from the hide of your prey, tan it and tool it and "
"bedeck it with teeth, so all shall know that you fear no bite. And your belt "
"shall be broad, and from it shall depend tassets of thick hide, the better "
"to protect your midsection when the prey turns at bay. \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Your boots shall be of tanned hide, thick and well-oiled, for you will hunt "
"your prey up streams and through swamps. Take care the soles are thick and "
"be-ridged, for you must be sure of foot when the surface is uncertain. Even "
"the best hunters fall to their prey when they slip and stumble. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Your bow shall be of heartwood and antler, for to shoot true in the forest, "
"the archer's tools must be of the forest. The limbs of your bow shall be "
"clawed, like the limbs of your prey, for like calls to like. And your quiver "
"shall show the face of a beast. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Your cuirass shall be many-layered and tough, and the breastplate shall be a "
"beastplate, with the glaring eyes and wrinkled nose of a predator hard on "
"the trail of its prey. And this is not strange, for beneath your cuirass "
"beats the heart of a hunter, pumping the blood of a beast.  \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"You shall bear a dirk like a long, curved claw, a steel talon with which to "
"gut your prey and skin its hide. It shall be deadly, yet simple and "
"unadorned, for does the bear paint its claws, or the falcon gild its talons? "
"They do not. So say I, and who shall contradict me? \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Your gauntlets shall be a mighty protection for your forearms, for the "
"biting beasts will try to grip your forelimbs with their fangs and wrestle "
"you to their level, and you must deny them this. Stud your gauntlet backs "
"with metal spikes to give them fangs of their own, but leave the fingers "
"free, nimble to grasp for arrows or dirk.  \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"When the beasts look upon you, they will see another beast looking back, for "
"your helm shall be a wolf's-head of steel. And this is as Storihbeg would "
"have it, for the Manbeast within shall manifest without, and the hunter "
"shall be exalted. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"To protect your legs your greaves shall be of the densest hide, and they "
"shall be studded with metal rivets, that they may turn the fangs of serpents "
"and blunt the tusks of boars. For while you are Beast you are also Man, and "
"must stay upright except when in form most feral. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"Your mace shall be heavy and spiked, like the fist of a kwama warrior, but "
"you shall strike twice as hard with it, for you are at once both Beast and "
"Man, and none who are of single nature shall stand before you. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"The beast-face on your chest and your helm shall be repeated on your shield, "
"of great size and feral aspect, so as to strike fear into your enemies from "
"a distance. Then you may smite them from afar, or close and savage them by "
"hand, as best suits your way of doing honor to Hircine. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"Your pauldrons shall be as you will, whether metal, leather, or fur, so long "
"as they are strong and solid to turn both blows and fangs.  For your "
"shoulder is anchor to the arm that brings your weapon down upon your prey. \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Every spell you cast from your staff shall do honor unto Lord Hircine, in "
"both his Princely form and in his aspect as Alrabeg. For your staff shall be "
"crowned with antlers like unto the Lord of the Hunt, and your spells shall "
"emit therefrom. This is the way, and no other!    \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"Your sword shall be long and curved, a great talon to extend the reach of "
"your mighty arm, and it shall have an edge that shall slash like the tusks "
"of a great boar. But it shall end in a point, for when your prey has "
"finished fighting for its life, you shall take that life quickly and cleanly "
"with a thrust to the heart. See to it."

"(And what does \"\"Morag Tong\"\" mean in ancient parlance but \"\"Forest "

"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"The Morag Tong are like woods hunters, except people are our prey. Our belts "
"are of simple stout leather, like a forester's, occasionally ornamented with "
"dreugh or mudcrab chitin—but don't get too fancy. Save that for the cuirass "
"and pauldrons. \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"The toes and uppers of Morag Tong shoes are protected by plates of chitin, "
"but the sides and soles are of flexible leather, tough but quiet. The goal "
"is to make sure our writ-targets never even hear us coming. Can you manage "
"that? For your sake, I hope you can.  \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Morag Tong archers wield composite bows of hardwood and horn, constructed on "
"fundamental principles that haven't changed for millennia. For flourish, add "
"metallic parry-crescents just above and below the central grip, with spider-"
"web supports to honor the Webspinner. (Don't pretend you don't know of whom "
"I speak.)\n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"A Morag Tong cuirass is designed to intimidate as well as to protect. The "
"base arming coat shall be of dark, heavy leather, ideally Bull Netch, "
"accented or (in heavier sets) layered with irregular plates of chitin. The "
"effect should be monstrous, as if the wearer were more crustacean than "
"person. Be imaginative! We have a reputation to maintain. \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"The blade on a Morag Tong dagger should be an offset demi-crescent, with a "
"hook or barb on the point so the dagger can double as a corpse meat-hook. "
"The hook must be able to drag a body without bending or slipping out—which "
"is what happened with that last batch you sent us. Don't you even test your "
"work before you call it done? \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"In the last batch of gauntlets you sent us, you got the leather quality and "
"the chitin plate on the back of the hand right, but you blundered by giving "
"the gloves full fingers instead of half-coverage. We do delicate work, all "
"right? We need the ends of our fingers free for things like picking locks "
"and twisting garottes around victims' necks. Gauntlets with half-fingers. "
"Got it? \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"You did a relatively good job with our flanged chitin helmets, but the visor "
"goggles were a complete failure. The heavy glass lenses were rippled, "
"distorting the wearer's vision and making everything viewed appear slightly "
"off-center. We can't be going in to cut a writ-target's throat and hit them "
"instead on the shoulder. Whatever source you've been using for lenses, "
"change it. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"These should be heavy leather—once again, Bull Netch if possible—with a top "
"layer of chitin plates. That's chitin, like from dreugh or mudcrabs, NOT "
"bone. We don't wear bone. Also, the sharp poleyns on the heavier armor "
"should jut out to the side rather than the front, because that's weirder and "
"looks more dangerous. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"For the Tong maces, we use a pretty traditional Chimer warhammer design, "
"with two heavy cylindrical heads. Sheath the haft below the head with metal "
"for parrying purposes. And make sure it's not too shiny: we don't want our "
"weapons to compromise stealth.  \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"I know the shield design looks like chitin, but it's actually ashwood faced "
"with metal. It only looks like layered chitin so as to be thematically "
"compatible with the Morag Tong armor, which is made of actual chitin. Is "
"this too confusing? Read it through several times slowly until you've got it."
" Then do it right. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"Getting the shoulders right is very important to maintaining the Morag Tong "
"armor's distinctive silhouette, so pay attention. The pauldrons are layers "
"of articulated chitin plates, like the cuirass, but the upper plates need to "
"have short curved spikes mounted on them. Use dreugh or shalk shell spurs "
"for this.  \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"There are only a few real spellcasters in the Tong, and I'm not one of them, "
"so I can't comment on where the design for our spell staves comes from, or "
"why it's so important we stick to it. I think the finial looks like a heavy "
"brass Dwarven fish, but that's just me. What matters to you is that you "
"follow the design as closely as you can.    \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"Morag Tong swords have one sharp edge, with a curve toward the point, which "
"ends in a back-barb like the dagger, and for the same reason: so it can "
"double as a corpse meat-hook. Put some irregular curved points on the "
"sword's spine, just so it looks nastier."

"All right, here's where we get fancy, with embossed Dragons and Argonian "
"nature-designs and Dunmeri what-have-you, I don't know what those things "

"these cuirasses aren't just for show: that's some solid steel and "
"leatherwork, there. \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"When it came to choosing a design for our Pact daggers, we turned to the "
"Dark Elves, because when it comes to sticking somebody in the back—no, maybe "
"I shouldn't say that. Anyway, you'll see the crossguard is adapted from "
"Tribunal symbology, though we did slap a Dragon on it. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"I wanted some serious Nord gauntlets for our Pact soldiers, but the Dunmer "
"and Argonians said they wanted their hands kept pretty free, so I got "
"overruled on that one. They're good gloves, though, with some decent mail on "
"the back of the heavier versions. \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"I must say, we outdid ourselves on the Pact helms, which have some proper "
"flaring wings and horns to them. Warms an old Nord's heart just to look at "
"them. They're solid, too, let me tell you, good protection all around, with "
"full visors. Good headgear. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"The front plates on the Pact greaves are nice and solid, and with enough "
"trim to look good on dress parade, too. And I like the pointy poleyns on "
"top—you want those when you're kneeing some milk-drinker in his stones. You "
"do that to an opponent, you don't want him getting up again for a payback. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"I like the one-handed Pact mace, it's a good, basic Argonian design: spikes, "
"heavy round head, what more do you need? I think we went a little overboard "
"on the two-hander, though, what with its three roaring Dragon heads and all. "
"Harder for the smiths to craft, and it won't knock your brains out any "
"better than its simpler little brother. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Pact shields take a basic Nord oval kite shape, and then add a bunch of "
"spikes around the outside because, I don't know, the Dunmer and the "
"Lizardfolk like lots of spikes. Oh, and we put a pair of big Dragons on the "
"front just to remind our enemies which alliance is about to bash the crap "
"out of them. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"The Dark Elves from House Redoran insisted on big, flaring pauldrons, so "
"that's what we gave them. And I have to hand it to them, they look good. "
"Sometimes those fellows know what they're talking about.  \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"By now you know what our alliance symbol is, right? So I'll give you one "
"guess as to what we put on the heads of the staves of our Pact spellcasters. "
"If you said \"\"roaring metal Dragons,\"\" give yourself a pat on the back. "
"If you said anything else, soldier, you're standing guard duty tonight, "
"because you're too dumb to be allowed to go into town.    \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"Like I said, we adapted a Dark Elf design for our Pact daggers, and it "
"looked so good we just up-scaled it for our warriors' swords. Same straight "
"blade, same semi-barbed point, same Tribunal-inspired crossguard with a "
"Dragon stamped on it. Nice sword. Nothing like a good sword."

"By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n"
"\n"
"The Ra Gada or \"\"Warrior Wave\"\" of settlers from Yokuda actually "
"occurred in four successive waves in the First Era's ninth century. This "
"catalogue focuses on the second, or \"\"Tavan\"\" wave, so-called because it "
"was spearheaded by the Hattu Metropoles brigade, which revered holy Tava, "
"Lady of the Air. Thus the Tavans' arms and armor are replete with bird "
"imagery. This second wave primarily settled on the southern coast of "
"Hammerfell, and almost three millennia later their structures can still be "
"found jutting from the coastal dunes. And one doesn't have to look far to "
"see the influence of these ancient settlers on modern Redguard society. \n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"Axe-wielders among the Tavans were taught with an emphasis on the "
"\"\"Singular Cleave\"\" attack, intended to cleave a target in twain with a "
"single blow. That's why these Ra Gada axes feature one large, heavy blade. \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"The belt is the central cincture of a much broader girdle, which provided an "
"extra layer of protection to the Ra Gada's abdomen and lower back. The "
"large, round buckle is embossed with air-current symbols. \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Ra Gadan boots are cobbled from heavy leather, usually camel hide, with "
"thick soles as insulation against hot sand and stones. The traditional "
"turned-up toes conceal metal caps to protect the soldier's vulnerable feet. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Aggressively avian in design, the bow of the Ra Gada is faced with two "
"brazen ibis-heads that can be employed as parrying edges in the heat of "
"melee. It's a compound bow, and the entire front is faced with horn, often "
"painted a metallic color. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"The Ra Gada were sword-fighters, and their cuirasses were solid and sturdy "
"to enable their wearers to withstand blows in close melee. They are covered "
"with swirling air-current symbols, and most feature the distinctive Tavan "
"bird-wing back banners.  \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"The daggers of the Tavan Ra Gada echo the scimitar-like curve of the second-"
"wave sword blades. The Tavans didn't use daggers for parrying, preferring to "
"use shields on their off-arms, so their daggers lack crossguards. They are, "
"however, weighted for throwing. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Ra Gada warriors, particularly those wielding two-handed weapons, were "
"trained to parry with their heavily-armored forearms rather than with their "
"weapons' crossguards. Their gloves, therefore, are basically reinforced "
"upper gauntlets that leave the fingers free for deft weapon manipulation. \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"The Tavan Redguards' headgear was typically a turban wound around a sturdy "
"steel cap, usually embossed with the near-universal wind-current symbols. "
"Most of the face was concealed by mouth and cheek guards, as much to "
"intimidate foes as to keep out blowing dust and sand. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Stiff and sturdy armor to protect the front of the lower legs was standard "
"gear for the second-wave Ra Gada, echoing the form and function of the "
"reinforced gauntlets on the forearms. Layers of heavy hide covered the back "
"of the calves.   \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"Ra Gada maces were made to deal with well-armored opponents, their heads "
"heavy and spiked for crushing and puncturing their targets. The weight of "
"these bludgeons necessitated development of the \"\"Terminal Blow\"\" style, "
"similar to the \"\"Singular Cleave\"\" used by Tavan axe-wielders. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Ra Gada shields were wide and heavy to provide maximum coverage, not just to "
"the bearer but also, at need, to his nearest ally. Besides the usual "
"embossed wind-current symbols, the bottom of the shield was wrought to "
"resemble a hawk's broad tail. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"The so-called \"\"pagoda pauldrons\"\" of the Ra Gada are quite distinctive, "
"but the three layers of cops are not as rigid as they appear: they are "
"articulated underneath, allowing the cops to swivel to follow the warrior's "
"arm movements. \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Ra Gada spellcasters often tipped their staves with finials in the shape of "
"Tu'whacca's sacred ibis, as the Tricky God was (and is) the patron of mages. "
"Nowadays being suspicious of magic is regarded as a hallmark of Redguard "
"culture, but this was not always so pronounced.   \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"The Tavans came from the Yokudan sword tradition that called for edging only "
"one side of the blade, so the backing can be thicker and stronger. This "
"gives the curved Ra Gada swords, both one- and two-handed, the weight to "
"hack through a target in one slash—and single-move attacks have always been "
"celebrated by Redguards as the epitome of fencing elegance."

"Listen up, smiths! We don't pound hot metal around here just because it's "
"fun. We forge for the glory of Malacath! Shoddy work will not be tolerated. "
"You don't want to craft anything you'll have to apologize to the Orc-Father "
"for when you get to the Ashpit. You want to make items in the Malacath Cult "
"style? Well, there's only one right way to do it, and that's to use the "
"Tilted Square, the symbol of instability. So pay attention! \n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"A Malacath axe blade is large, of course, because with blades, bigger is "
"better. And it's covered with chevrons and tilted squares, because that's "
"the Malacath Way. Axes are all about chopping things down and making them "
"fall over, so naturally we cover them with symbols of instability. Any "
"questions? Didn't think so. \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"We like to keep our belts simple and not too broad, because most of us have "
"enough trouble bending over as it is. Ha! But we make them of the finest "
"possible materials, such as top-grade mammoth leather, and we craft them to "
"the highest standards. Because Malacath demands it!\n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Whether you encounter snow or ice, rock or ash, Malacath expects you to keep "
"going. Our boots are crafted from the finest hide and soled with small "
"cleats for traction. And because we must trust our boots to keep us stable "
"on any surface, we decorate them, not with the tilted square, but with the "
"chevron: upright for stability, or inverted for grip. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Melee, hand to hand and chest to chest, honors Malacath. Sticking an arrow "
"in someone from a distance does not. For Malacath, a bow is a hunter's tool, "
"not a warrior's weapon. So bows in the Malacath Cult style are lighter and "
"simpler than the other weapons in our armory. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"In battle, the Orc-Father calls for a layered defense, with Orcs supporting "
"their fellow warriors left and right and before and behind. Everyone has an "
"equal chance to bring honor to Malacath. Likewise, the warriors of Malacath "
"wear cuirasses layered of fur and stiffened armor, usually with a great cowl-"
"gorget extending across the chest and upper back. \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"The daggers of Malacath are versatile weapons, strongly made, slightly "
"curved—and with an edge on both sides of the blade, because sometimes we "
"must reverse to stab those who attack us from behind. Treachery is "
"everywhere. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"The gauntlets of the Cult of Malacath reach all the way to the elbow and are "
"adorned with chevrons, the symbol of deflection, for we are taught to parry, "
"at need, with the forearm. We also know that when attacked from behind by so-"
"called friends, the best defense is a half-turn and a savage backhanded blow."
"   \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Our helms and hoods are layered, like our cuirasses, and likewise ornamented "
"with Malacath's tilted square. They are sturdy but not too heavy: since "
"betrayal is inevitable, Orcs must be constantly looking askance. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Malacath teaches us that, just as our enemies speak fair before they act "
"foul, it is the way of our enemies to feint high and then attack low. "
"Therefore we take special care with our greaves. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"Malacath! Forge-Founder! Smith-Father! We honor you in battle by wielding "
"the hammer, pounding your foes the same way we hammer out hot steel! Heavy "
"are our hammers, ever ready to smite with the power of the Tilted Square!\n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"The kite-shaped shields of the Cult of Malacath sport the sacred chevron and "
"the Tilted Square. What is not obvious to the eye is that they are many-"
"layered, of folded steel over laminates of hardwood. Our shields are light, "
"but nigh-impenetrable. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"In battle Malacath decrees a layered defense, and so it is with our armor, "
"our pauldrons, faulds, cowters, and poleyns adding layers to our base armor, "
"all adorned with the holy geometries. The pauldron that covers the off-"
"shoulder often sports a knob or boss, to protect the arm of defense.\n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"As spellcasters of the Cult of Malacath devote their energies to the "

"By the Venerable Uugus, Priest of Trinimac\n"
"\n"
"The Elves have forgotten the warrior ideals of Trinimac, but we Orsimer keep "
"them alive! As the Children of Trinimac, we embody his stoic courage and "
"bold audacity. The arms we bear and the armor we wear shine with gold, in "
"remembrance of Trinimac's golden skin. And they are accented with polished "
"ebony, in token of Lorkhan's blood when Trinimac tore out his heart. \n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"The axes of the Trinimac Cult are notched to evoke the hero Avalian's axe, "
"that was damaged when it cracked the heart of the fire mountain. The blades "
"are embossed with Vaia's Golden Ash, symbol of strength and unity of the "
"Orcs. \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"For the worshiper of Trinimac, the belt symbolizes the faith in the Golden "
"Champion that binds the Orsimer together. Its buckle evokes the Champion's "
"golden helmet, surrounding a quartz crystal that represents the clarity of "
"Trinimac's vision.  \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"The Children of Trinimac are warriors, so our shoes are sabatons, armored "
"boots with metal-shod toes, gleaming with the light of the Golden Champion. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Our bows are crafted to emulate that of Elsarel, the Orsimer hero who slew "
"the colossal Daedroth Zetthax with a single arrow through the eye. It is "
"said Elsarel did honor to the Golden Champion by practicing with the bow for "
"20 hours out of every 24. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"The cuirasses of the Cult of Trinimac are the highest expression of the "
"cult's devotion to the perfection of artistic labor: intricate, ornate, rife "
"with symbolism, and yet supremely crafted to perform their function of "
"protecting the warrior in battle. In garb the warrior of Trinimac is ever "
"resplendent!\n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"Our daggers are forged of the finest steel, bifurcated into twin thrusting "
"blades to represent the dual nature of Trinimac, the Golden Champion who is "
"both slayer and protector. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"The followers of Trinimac wear gloves of softest leather to enable fine "
"manipulation, but cover their backs with articulated gauntlets of gilded "
"splints. \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"The warriors of Trinimac wear gilded helms in emulation of the Champion's "
"helmet, often with golden full-face visors to evoke Trinimac's stern "
"features. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Full greaves, gilded and with knee poleyns, protect the legs of the warriors "
"who fight for Trinimac, seamlessly overlapping the sabatons on the feet.  \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"Those who follow the way of Trinimac call their rounded maces the \"\"fists "
"of Usunok,\"\" after the Orsimer hero who could down a full-sized mammoth "
"with a single punch. The cylindrical head encloses a lead ball that rolls "
"outward as the weapon is swung, adding force to the blow. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"The shield of a Trinimac warrior is embossed with Vaia's Golden Ash, the "
"tree from which she carved out the shield that repelled the blow of Rhogar "
"the Destroyer, and which symbolizes the strength, heritage, and unity of the "
"Orsimer people.  \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"The pauldrons of a warrior of Trinimac soar like the wings of Zylvara, the "
"great eagle that bore the Golden Champion to his reckoning with the man-"
"demon Quarvish. \n"
" \n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Ebony is said to be the solidified blood of Lorkhan, spilled across Tamriel "
"when Trinimac ripped out his heart with more than hands. Therefore, in the "
"Cult of Trinimac, we adorn our spellcasters' staves with knobs and insets of "
"polished ebony. \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"The sword of a warrior of Trinimac gleams like lightning forged into steel. "
"The one-handed swords are bifurcated like the daggers, but the greatswords "
"are long, single blades, straight and without a taper until just short of "
"the point."
