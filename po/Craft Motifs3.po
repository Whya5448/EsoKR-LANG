"By Vandalion Brightsteel, Armorsmith Peerless of Vulkhel Guard\n"
"\n"
"During the recent strife in Firsthold, certain reference works were lost "
"from the great library, so His Excellency Kinlord Rilis has asked the "
"leading experts of Auridon to replace them with new accounts. For the "
"definitive description of the Glass crafting style, naturally our wise "
"sovereign turned to me. \n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"The avian motif typically of the Glass style is particularly prominent in "
"the axe designs, where the glass-edged blades are crafted to resemble the "
"wings of a bird of prey. The blades' feathered appearance is strictly "
"cosmetic; the scoring that produces the feathered look is too shallow to "
"weaken the blade, but is deep enough to create blood gutters.  \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"The belt on a suit of glass armor is usually a single cincture of some "
"exotic leather, adorned with glass bosses in rhomboid or pentagonal shapes. "
"Geometrical tassets depend from either hip, and there may be a chevron-"
"shaped fauld in front to protect the groin.  \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Elegant footwear indeed! These vary from sturdy leather moccasins with glass "
"toe-guards with light armor, up to steel-and-glass sabatons with heavy armor."
" Flexibility is paramount, as Elven soldiers favor agility over thickness of "
"plate. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Glass-style bows are compound and recurved, with a wooden grip and limbs of "
"horn. The front of the curve and back of the recurve are faced with glass "
"for maximum power. Non-glass parts of the bow are often painted with a "
"metallic lacquer, so that a flash of reflected sunlight ripples along the "
"line as a troop of archers raises their bows for a volley. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"The downward-pointing chevrons on Glass cuirasses evoke the deep-muscled "
"chests of great flying creatures, and indeed the chest plates are often "
"adorned with images of eagles, dragons, or cliff racers. They are "
"constructed of leather, steel, and glass, with as much additional glass trim "
"as the buyer can afford. \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"A Summerset glass dagger is the finest fighting knife there is. The glass on "
"a Glass-style dagger is usually confined to the point and edge, with accents "
"on the pommel; the tang, guard, and core of the blade are of steel. They are "
"capable weapons, equally useful for slashing, stabbing, or parrying.  \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Glass-style gauntlets typically feature thin, flexible leather gloves, with "
"glass strips protecting the back of the hand and the forearms. The elbows "
"are covered by triangular glass-faced cowters that echo the shape of the "
"pauldrons above.  \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Glass-style headpieces extend the winged motif of the cuirasses and "
"pauldrons upward; they often have armored crests, cheek-wings, and winged "
"cranium caps. Glass, polished to a glossy sheen, trims every edge. A fine "
"glass helmet is a sight to behold. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Whether light, medium, or heavy, all greaves in this magnificent style are "
"constructed of sturdy but flexible leather faced with glass. The main "
"difference is the amount and thickness of the glass banding, and the size of "
"the shield-shaped glass poleyns that protect the knees. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"Glass-style maces and hammers feature elegant but heavy steel heads with "
"glass-tipped studs and spikes. The hafts are made of a dense but flexible "
"wood such as ash, faced with steel languets and ending in a steel roundel "
"heavy enough to partially offset the weight of the head. That enables these "
"long-hafted weapons to be whirled almost like quarterstaves. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"For a shield that is nearly all metal, glass shields are remarkably light, "
"precisely because they're mostly glass plates held in a slender matrix of "
"steel. Two broad glass wings, usually avian-themed, flare out from central "
"steel ribs to broad \"\"feathered\"\" edges. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDERS\n"
"\n"
"The Glass-style pauldrons are integrated with the shapes of the chest "
"pieces, extending the winged motif onto the shoulders and down into the "
"upper-arm rerebraces. The marine version of this style resembles breaking "
"waves rather than wings. \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"A staff in the Glass style is many a wizard's proudest possession. The long "
"wooden shaft, sheathed in steel languets to protect it while parrying, is "
"simple enough; it's the elaborate winged finial that is the glory of a glass "
"staff. The steel head, often set with large turquoises, unfolds on either "
"side into a pair of exquisite glass wings, evoking birds, bats, or Dragons. "
"The entire finial seems to glow with inner fire. \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"A Glass sword is a cunning combination of steel core and tang with a glass "
"point and edges. The blade may be quite broad near the tip, and even "
"\"\"feathered\"\" with shallow blood gutters. Despite their size, the blades "
"are light, favored by sword-fighters for their ease of use and battlefield "
"durability—for a glass sword will hold its edge long after a steel or alloy "
"sword has gone dull."

"쓰이고, 슴베와 날밑, 검날의 중심부는 강철로 되어 있다. 글래스 단검은 베기, 찌르기, 혹은 쳐내기 모두에 유용하게 쓰이는 다재다능한 "

"\n"
"대부분이 금속으로 이루어진 글래스 방패는 놀라울 만큼 가벼우며, 이는 금속의 대부분이 얇은 강철 틀로 고정된 글래스 판이기 때문이다. 두 "

"가장자리까지 뻗어 나온다.\n"
"\n"
"어깨보호구\n"

"\n"
"지팡이\n"
"\n"
"글래스 양식의 지팡이는 많은 마법사들이 가장 자랑스러워하는 소유물이다. 길다란 목재 손잡이는 강철을 덧대는 단순한 방법으로 공격을 쳐낼 "
"수 있는 방어력을 제공한다. 정교하게 만들어진 날개 모양의 꼭대기 장식은 글래스 지팡이의 찬란한 아름다움이다. 그 강철 머리에는 종종 "
"커다란 터키석을 끼워넣으며, 양쪽에 펼쳐진 한 쌍의 아름다운 글래스 날개로 새, 박쥐, 혹은 드래곤을 표현한다. 꼭대기 장식 전체는 "

"검\n"
"\n"
"글래스 검은 강철 중심부와 슴베를 글래스 칼끝과 검날에 정교하게 결합시킨 결과물이다. 검날은 끝부분 근처에서 꽤나 넓어지는 모양새이며, "
"심지어는 피가 타고 흘러내릴 \\\\\"\\\\\"깃털달린\\\\\"\\\\\" 틈새도 존재한다. 검날은 그 크기에도 불구하고 가벼우며, "
"사용의 편리함과 전장에서의 내구성으로 검사들에게 단연 인기다. 글래스 검은 강철이나 합금 금속으로 만든 검이 무뎌진 뒤에도 오랫동안 그 "
"날을 변함없이 유지할 것이다."

"beautiful and formidable. They often had long, curved cutting edges, giving "
"them some of the virtues of swords.  \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"Yokudan belts tended not to be elaborate, because what mattered was what "
"hung from them: the all-important sword or other weapon, as well as tassets "
"for hip protection. The buckle was usually a strong and simple geometric "
"design. \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Yokudan boots were made for combat, of heavy leather with strategically-"
"placed metal plates for protection. But they were also flexible and rugged "
"for marching across the harsh Yokudan terrain. \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"The Yokudans had little esteem for archery, deeming it less honorable than "
"melee combat, and their gallants and grandees left it to the common foot "
"soldier. A Yokudan archer or light skirmisher was usually armed with a "
"simple self bow adorned with modest metal facings. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"For Yokudans, the art of weapon combat was profoundly athletic, so while "
"their cuirasses offered solid central protection for the chest and back, the "
"arm, shoulder, and waist areas were covered with flexible leather for "
"maximum agility. \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"A Yokudan dagger just looks like a smaller version of a Yokudan sword, and "
"indeed they tended to be large, approaching short swords in size. A large "
"dagger in the off hand was a common choice for Yokudan dual wielders. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Yokudan warriors emphasized sword fighting above all other weapon styles, "
"and in swordplay the hands are always under threat, so Yokudan gauntlets "
"were heavy and multi-layered, with flaring upper sleeves to protect the "
"forearms. \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Yokudan helm designs are clearly descended from the turbaned hats of ancient "
"pastoral nomads. They typically had aventails to protect the back of the "
"neck, full visors covering the face, and even horns on the forehead or crest."
" \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Yokudan chausses were strong to protect against low cuts in swordplay, often "
"with metal plates covering both the shin in front and the calves in back, to "
"prevent hamstringing attacks. Pointed knee poleyns were common as well. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"The Yokudans were so attached to the idea of edged blades that they even "
"mounted them on the heads of their maces, where you might find spikes or "
"flanges in another crafting style. Some of these edged blades even came to "
"points in the \"\"broad arrowhead\"\" design.  \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Yokudan shields might be round, oval, or kite-shaped, but all were fitted "
"with blade-turning metal plates around their edges, and round central bosses "
"featuring geometric designs. They appeared to be entirely metal, but were "
"actually made of metallic plates riveted to wooden frames. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDERS\n"
"\n"
"Though the shoulders themselves were sheathed in flexible leather to enable "
"acrobatic swordplay, above that the joints were protected by sharp and often "
"elaborate pauldrons, cops that flared at the top to guard the side of the "
"neck. \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"The rare Yokudan war-wizards employed staves designed to resemble melee "
"weapons to borrow some of the prestige of hand-to-hand combat. Their "
"metallic finials might be round, flared, or pointed in the \"\"broad "
"arrowhead\"\" design. \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"Though the curved Yokudan swords weren't elaborately embellished, they "
"nonetheless represented the apogee of Yokudan weapon-making, having been "
"forged and re-forged in a long process designed to make them unbreakable and "
"invincible. Yokudan warriors regarded their swords as extensions of their "
"essential selves."

"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Boots of the northern Akaviri tend to be simple and utilitarian, for "

"more elaborate and decorative, with shoes and greaves that look like "
"Imperial sandals, though armored with thick leather or small metal plates. \n"

"metal, nor do the Akaviri have the giant's-strength it would take to bend "
"them if they were. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Akaviri chest armor is worked or forged from familiar materials—padding, "
"leather, steel—and usually decorated with a triangular or pyramidal shape, "
"point toward the gorget. \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"Akaviri daggers are pretty, but don't be fooled: they're made for killing, "
"and if you get downed on the battlefield, expect to feel one of these in "
"your armpit or groin. As with the swords, the curved ones are Tsaesci, and "
"the straight ones are from Kamal.  \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Akaviri weapons usually have narrow guards, which leaves hand protection up "
"to their gauntlets. These usually have thick armor on the back of the hand, "
"while leaving the fingers free and open for a solid grip on weapon and "
"shield.  \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"The Tsaesci helmets I've seen in museums, or imitated by Fighters Guild "
"warriors, sport layered neck and side armor, and often have elaborate double "
"crests like horns or antlers. Kamali helmets, in contrast, tend to be "
"simpler, though they also cover the back and sides. Lots of Akaviri helmets "
"of both kinds include visors or some other form of partial face coverage. "
"The troops found some of these unsettling, even creepy. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"Akaviri greaves always look like extensions of their sandal-like boots. I "
"could never tell where one ends and the other starts. \n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"Kamali maces usually have rectangular heads, while those of the Tsaesci are "
"round. Both kinds are studded all round with wicked spikes. They're going to "
"hurt you, even if you're wearing heavy armor.  \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Shields from Kamal tend to be metal-edged wood from the northern forests, "
"while shields from southern Tsaesci are more likely to be curved sheets of "
"steel. These often sport symbols echoing the crests on the warriors' helms. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDERS\n"
"\n"
"Unlike the triangular designs on their chest armor, Akaviri pauldrons and "
"shoulder cops are always articulated rectangular or square plates. Why? Who "
"knows? \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"An Akaviri mage prizes his spell staff, and they are often splendid and "
"lavishly decorated, trimmed in gold leaf and sporting great red gems. The "
"hafts of these staves are made of a dense, flexible wood unknown in Tamriel, "
"able to deflect even a great axe. \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"The Akaviri seem to love their swords almost as much as the Redguards; their "
"long blades are among the finest I've ever seen. When you heft one of the "
"curved Tsaesci swords, you can just feel how it could shear right through a "
"soldier's limbs. And the straight blades of Kamal are no less dangerous."

"\n"
"Dwemeri axe designs reflect the wheels, gears, and cogs that are central to "

"by the addition or subtraction of a few links. The tensile strength of such "
"a belt is without peer, many times that of an equivalent length of steel "
"chain. \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Dwarven boots are sturdy, but not as heavy as they look. Though they have "
"accents of Dwarven metal, they are mainly constructed of a flexible material "
"that resembles leather, but either it is some sort of manufactured "
"imitation, or the Dwemer had beasts with incredibly smooth and homogenous "
"hide. Knee-high Dwarven boots often incorporate built-in greaves over the "
"shins.\n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Dwarven recurved bows are powerful and can drive an arrow through an oaken "
"board. Though they appear to made of metal, they are not; the strong yet "
"flexible material they are made from is otherwise unknown, and cannot be "
"duplicated by modern bowyers. \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"All Dwarven chest armor consists of metal plates of various sizes affixed to "
"a leather cuirass—thin, flexible leather with a few small plates in the case "
"of light armor, the leather becoming thicker and the plates larger and more "
"numerous as the armor gets heavier. The plates are typically geometric in "
"shape and ornamentation. \n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"A Dwarven dagger typically has a broad and heavy triangular blade, as "
"suitable for chopping as for stabbing. In fact, they resemble tools as much "
"as they do weapons. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"Dwarven gloves were always made of fine and flexible leather or pseudo-"
"leather, reflecting their wearers' need for fine manipulation of their "
"devices. Only the heaviest gauntlets sported metal ribs, typically "
"tessellated splints protecting the back of the hands. \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Dwarven helmets of all kinds famously cover the entire face with a face-"
"shaped visor, curiously bisected down the center by a sort of metal keel. "
"This keel reappears atop the helmet as a crest, which may be modest or "
"bizarrely exaggerated. A line of Dwemer troops, all wearing helmets with "
"identical, impassive visages, must have struck terror into the Deep Elves' "
"enemies.\n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"The leg protection of the Dwemer typically consisted of geometric plates or "
"cylinders of metal, mounted on the same thick yet flexible material used for "
"their boots. The armor was particularly thick over the knee.\n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"Dwarven maces have heavy and blunt geometrical heads, without flanges, "
"spikes, or pointed finials. The two-handed maces are outweighed only by "
"Orcish skull-crushers, and can bend and batter plate armor as if it was foil."
" \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Dwarven shields come in many shapes, but all echo the geometric forms seen "
"on Dwemer armor, albeit writ large. They are formed from relatively thin "
"plates of Dwarven metal, and are much lighter and wieldier than they appear. "
"\n"
"\n"
"SHOULDERS\n"
"\n"
"Dwarven shoulder pauldrons were usually made of thick and inflexible metal, "
"mounted on cops of heavy \"\"leather.\"\" The pauldrons of heavier armor "
"sometimes sported metal keels echoing the crests seen atop their helmets. \n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"Even the most elaborate Dwarven staff has a utilitarian look about it, as if "
"it was going to be used with a paddle to draw a loaf of bread from an oven. "
"The haft is made of some close-grained substance that looks like wood but is "
"not, circled with rings of Dwarven metal. The finials are circular or fan-"
"shaped, and usually modest in size. \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"Dwarven swords look like mere extensions of their daggers, featuring the "
"same broad, triangular blades with both point and edge. Their cross-guards "
"are slender to almost nonexistent, which argues that Dwemer swordplay did "
"not rely much on thrusting."

"Continuing my compilation of Doctor Alfidia Lupus' notes for studies of "
"clothing, arms, and armor in diverse cultural styles….\n"
"\n"
"It is entirely appropriate that this last entry in Doctor Lupus' \"\"Racial "
"Motifs\"\" series should be about Daedric arms and armor, as it is my belief "
"that the absent Lady Alfidia has somehow journeyed to the Daedric planes of "
"Oblivion in pursuit of my lost Professor Morian Zenas. And as I can now hear "
"the Professor's voice whispering in my ear almost constantly, it is time to "
"conclude these notes and move on to telling the story of his travels through "
"the doors of Oblivion. \n"
"\n"
"The Daedra, as the Professor has so often remarked, are creatures of chaos, "
"entities of great energy and force but entirely lacking in originality. They "
"can imitate, they can exaggerate, and they can corrupt, but they cannot "
"create anything new. That is a capability inherent only in the Aedra, and in "
"we mortals of Nirn, to whom they gave it as a gift. (In Black Marsh we see "
"such things differently, of course, but these are the beliefs of the "
"Professor and Lady Alfidia.)\n"
"\n"
"Thus the armor and weapons of such Daedra as the Dremora, Xivilai, and "
"Golden Saints—what Doctor   Lupus calls the \"\"humanoid\"\" Daedra—consist "
"of familiar Tamriel-style cuisses, breastplates, and pauldrons, swords, "
"spears, and bows. They may to our eyes be ornamented with outlandish spikes "
"and melodramatic flourishes, but look inside a suit of Daedric armor and "
"you'll find the familiar padding and straps that enable it to be worn by "
"anyone of conventional shape. Pick up a Daedric sword, and despite its "
"bizarre shape you will find the grip comfortable, the heft well-balanced. "
"Indeed, it is said that the famous Artifacts of the Daedric Princes, such as "
"the Mace of Molag Bal, were mostly made by mortal artisans who were enticed "
"or forced to create them. \n"
"\n"
"Yes, Professor, I believe that is enough—for now, at least. I have done my "
"duty to the good doctor. I am sitting in your study, and I am listening. "
"Tell me again of Moonshadow."

"You might look at the gear sported by a fully-equipped Goblin warchief and "
"think, \"\"What a mismatched conglomeration of primitive paraphernalia.\"\" "
"But you would be wrong. Each item that warchief is wearing was carefully "
"selected for its proven utility, and represents a decision backed by "
"millennia of tradition. This is a style of arms and armor we ethnographers "
"call the \"\"Primal,\"\" and it is as distinctive and recognizable as any "
"other culture set. \n"
"\n"
"Goblins and other folk who have adopted the Primal style are typically "
"superb scavengers and looters. They seem to have a special sense for where "
"to find the sort of cast-off yet serviceable, even exceptional  equipment "
"that will fit the Primal esthetic. And they are as proud of their turn-out "
"as any Imperial centurion.\n"
"\n"
"Recent scholarship by Doctor Intricatus of Gwylim University confirms this, "
"and adds some new information that shows that \"\"primal\"\" is, indeed, the "
"optimal label for this style. His study of the fifty-seven Primal ensembles "
"worn by the massacred Knife-Biter Goblin tribe showed that many of the items "
"found on the corpses were hundreds, if not thousands of years old. Some of "
"the greaves and cuirasses appeared to date from the early First Era, and "
"represented ancient forging techniques that have since been lost to history. "
"Did the Goblins loot these from ancient Cyrodilic ruins, as they've been "
"known to do? Or did they actually pass them down, generation by generation, "
"since time immemorial? \n"
"\n"
"Yes, Professor Zenas, that IS how you spell \"\"immemorial.\"\" Wait … what? "
"Professor? Is that your voice?"

"Despite the civilizing influence of our noble Second Empire, Tamriel still "
"has its backwaters and hinterlands inhabited by barbarous tribes. Probably "
"the most familiar to us Cyrodilics are the savage clans of the Reachmen, who "
"dwell in the wild mountains between Skyrim and High Rock, and whose raiders "

"also the Ashlanders of Morrowind, the fierce Kothringi of Black Marsh, the "
"Ket Keptu of central Hammerfell, and many others. \n"
"\n"
"It is a strange but undeniable fact that these tribes, farflung across the "
"continent though they are, have strikingly similar tastes in apparel. Why "
"this should be is fodder for another ethnographic study more speculative "
"than this one, which is merely descriptive. (Therefore, on to the "
"description.)\n"
"\n"
"This clannish or tribal style, though commonly known as \"\"Barbaric,\"\" is "
"really no less sophisticated than that of other cultures. The so-called "
"barbaric tribes simply disdain all ideas of tasteful restraint, preferring "
"the lurid and bizarre. Bright colors are favored, and materials may be "
"lacquered to almost any hue. Typical accouterments include skulls, antlers, "
"feathers, strings of teeth, accents of beaten copper, and weapons "
"ostentatious in size and number. \n"
"\n"
"(I feel the need to interject here that much of this description could also "
"apply to the styles of my native Black Marsh, a region that could scarcely "
"be described as \"\"barbaric\"\"! Pfui. I shall return to this cultural "

"The master—I mean the Professor, Morian Zenas—is gone. So is Lady Alfidia, "
"though I always addressed her as Doctor Lupus. So, for that matter, is the "
"Telvanni, but he, at least, will not be missed—nasty mer, always making "
"caustic comments about \"\"the scaleskin help\"\" whenever the Professor "
"wasn't around. \n"
"\n"
"No, I am glad the Telvanni is gone. But the others … well.\n"
"\n"
"I will stay on here as long as I may, keeping the Professor's town house in "

"still hope for his return. For now, the University has him listed as \"\"On "
"Sabbatical,\"\" and sends his stipend to me so I can maintain his residence "
"and arcane workshop. \n"
"\n"
"It was while in the study, straightening the Professor's desk, that I came "
"across a stack of notes in Lady Alfidia's elegant handwriting, unfinished "
"studies of clothing, arms, and armor in several cultural styles. The river "
"flows slowly these days, so I have decided to organize these style notes in "
"a fashion that (I hope) approximates how the lady doctor would have done so "
"herself. \n"
"\n"
"Though notes about the styles of the leading Elven societies of current-day "
"Tamriel have already been compiled, there is more to say, as the mer, who "
"revere their ancestors and ancestry, have a special regard for the history "
"of Aldmeri culture. The Merethic Era, when Elves first conquered and "
"colonized Tamriel, they regard as a golden age to be emulated. As a result "
"the clothing and armor of that period never really goes out of style, and "
"many Elves still affect the styles and manners of the ancient Aldmeri. It is "
"not at all unusual, even on continental Tamriel, to encounter a High Elf or "
"Dark Elf dressed like an ancient Ayleid or Chimer. The Elves call this "
"practice \"\"draping Ehlnofic,\"\" but the rest of us just call it "
"\"\"Ancient Elven\"\" and leave it at that. \n"
"\n"
"(I will add here to the absent lady's notes that I myself, though having "
"lived in the Imperial capital for many long years, have never seen a Wood "
"Elf sporting this Ancient Elven style. But the Bosmer, like we Argonians, "
"seem to prefer to live in the Aurbic Now, showing relatively little regard "
"for the ways of former ages.)\n"
"\n"
"Ancient Elven is different from Elven styles favored by modern artisans of "
"Summerset and Morrowind in that it is somewhat more organic, and yet at the "
"same time more abstract. Flowing floral motifs are common, usually tapering "
"to a sharp point or end, as in the sharp-peaked arches so familiar to the "
"inhabitants of Cyrodiil from our ubiquitous Ayleid ruins. Circles, semi-"
"circles, and arcs abound, often containing the organic tapering tendrils, "
"much as the Aedra (whom the Elves claim as ancestors) were constrained by "
"the creation of the Mundus.\n"

"\n"

"\n"
"Seif-ij told me, emotion quivering even in his flat reptilian voice, of how "

"pleas to return. How Apocrypha … entranced him. \n"

"This morning my maid Dariella came to me all a-twitter with the news that "
"there was a lizard-woman at the door, asking for me and insisting it was "
"urgent. There aren't many Argonians in the City, and it occurred to me this "
"might be a relative of Seif-ij, sent with some dreadful news about Morian, "
"so I donned my University robe and hurried down. \n"
"\n"
"There was indeed a young lizard-woman waiting in the street, clad in a "
"fetching spidersilk jumper adorned with intricate spiral designs. She said "
"her name was Lifts-Her-Tail (which I thought must be a joke, but who can "
"tell, given these reptilians' impassive features), and she'd been sent to "
"bring me to her master, Desh-Wulm the Perspicuous. She said she didn't know "
"what it was about, but it was a matter of some urgency, and she was to lead "
"me to her master immediately. I nodded, nervously, and followed. \n"
"\n"
"The Argonian lass led me out the Temple gate and down to the Docks, far out "
"on the end of which we found a curious old house I'd never before noticed, "
"with a dark sign by the door that read \"\"The Xanmeer\"\"—a word unfamiliar "
"to me. We went inside to find a large house entirely occupied by Argonians, "
"a dozen or so who seemingly lived there using all the rooms in common. "
"Everywhere I looked I saw Argonian hangings, sculptures, and fetishes, all "
"made from natural materials such as shells, bone, and feathers, glowing with "
"bright spiral and geometric designs. If these objects were representative of "
"what the Argonians used in their home regions, then snakeskin, tortoise "
"shell, jagged teeth, turquoise and jade, all of which we would consider "
"exotic materials, must be commonplace in Black Marsh. \n"
"\n"
"Lifts-Her-Tail led me up a ramp that had apparently replaced the house's "
"staircase. On the upper level she introduced me to a humid room that, to me "
"at least, smelled of decay and mold. Coughing, I entered, discovering a room "
"almost entirely full of potted jungle plants—some of them seemingly long-"
"dead and rotting. I stepped on something that squished beneath my sandal and "
"stepped involuntarily back, but the lizard-lass gently took my hand, drew me "
"past a wall of ferns and into the center of the room. \n"
"\n"
"There, incongruously, I discovered a large porcelain Nibenese bathtub, like "
"the one in my own vanity chamber, though this one was filled almost to the "
"rim with a noisome, greenish mud. And lying in this mud, nose barely above "
"the surface, was the oldest Argonian I'd ever seen. \n"
"\n"
"In fact, the withered and wizened lizard-man looked so much like a mummy I "
"was startled when it opened its mouth and spoke. In a voice like creaking "
"leather, the reptilian slowly said, \"\"I am Desh-Wulm. You are Al-Phid, "
"Brightest Star of the City. You are welcome in my uxith—my nest.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"He seemed to be looking someplace over my shoulder, and I saw that the old "
"lizard's eyes were clouded over with an opalescent film—he was blind. This "
"infirmity was somehow reassuring, enabling me to regain my self-possession "
"and fall gratefully into the routines of etiquette. I bowed—though he "
"couldn't see it—and said, \"\"I am honored to be received into your home, "
"venerable Desh-Wulm. How can one such as I be of service to an Elder of "
"Wisdom?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You can beware!\"\" he croaked, scaled hands emerging from the mud and "
"levering him up on the rim of the bathtub. \"\"Your dryskin mages—the weft "
"unravels about them,\"\" he said, more calmly, making an unfamiliar spiral "
"gesture above the tub. \"\"It is wrong. The Aurbic skeins should not be "
"disjoined with intent of malice.\"\" \n"
"\n"
"I had been around wizards long enough to guess at what he meant. "
"\"\"Morian?\"\" I gasped. \"\"And Divayth? They're in danger? What can I "
"do?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Desh-Wulm clacked his jaws twice, and then said, \"\"You are capable. You "
"must stop them. You will prevail. If not,\"\" three sharp spines rose up "
"from his brow, \"\"there will be ill dreams and serration for all who swim "
"the river. Kaoc!\"\" The old Argonian suddenly began thrashing about in the "
"tub, spilling muck over the sides. \"\"Theilul!\"\" \n"
"\n"
"Lifts-Her-Tail deftly picked up a jug that seemed to be made from a single "
"insect's carapace, uncorked it, and poured some brown liquor down the old "
"lizard-man's throat. \"\"Go!\"\" she hissed, pointing toward the door. "
"\"\"Do as he says! Now!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I turned, ran out of the room, down the ramp, out the door, and back to the "
"Imperial City."

"the University at the Potentate's state dinner for the new envoy from "
"Orsinium. He must really be busy to skip that event, as I know he was keen "
"to go. Well, all the better for my Racial Motifs project, I suppose—work, "
"work, work will take my mind off my worries!\n"
"\n"
"The new province of Orsinium doesn't have an embassy yet, so for the dinner "
"the Potentate's snake-staff set up a row of pavilions on the grounds of the "
"White-Gold Tower. To honor Envoy Thuggikh they were all decorated with "
"authentic Orcish paraphernalia imported from Wrothgar, so I got out my "
"journal and took notes during the interminable speeches. \n"
"\n"
"Strange to think that a folk as brutish as the Orcs seem to be could design "
"and create objects of such sophistication! Of course they're known across "
"Tamriel as fine armorers, but I'd always assumed that was due to their great "
"strength rather than skill. A glance at their arms and armor was enough to "
"show me how wrong my assumption had been. Though never ornate or over-"
"embellished, their metalwork, though even simpler and more utilitarian than "
"the Nords', displays a deep understanding of the laws of proportion, "
"symmetry, and harmonic congruity. An Orcish sword may be a weapon of "
"violence, but to contemplate the dynamic sweep of its blade, visually "
"balanced by its heavy but shapely hilt, obviously molded to flow into the "
"hand of its wielder—why, it's almost restful and reassuring. \n"
"\n"
"Afterwards at the reception I was happy to see somebody I recognized in Lady "
"Opel the Arch-Magister. She greeted me warmly and, over some West Weald wine "
"and Eidar cheese, asked me how things were going with me and my pair of "
"wizards. I told her I thought I'd made a terrible muddle of things, but she "
"assured me everything would work out in the end. She said she's known Morian "
"for ever so long, and he's really quite sensible beneath his fussy old-man "
"ways. She was glad he'd found someone as clever as I to keep him from "
"completely vanishing into his laboratory. \n"
"\n"
"But as far as I'm concerned, that's exactly what he's done. I think I'll go "
"talk to Seif-ij again—maybe he can help me get through to Morian before he "
"leaves."

"\n"
"When I went to the professor's townhouse this morning, my first priority was "
"to apologize to Divayth, but Seif-ij told me he was out—he'd gone somewhere "
"from the portal chamber, using an incantation and leaving nothing behind but "
"a burnt smell. Onward, I told myself: work will take your mind off it. So I "
"went looking for Morian. \n"
"\n"
"I found the old dear at breakfast, just finishing his sweet roll and chal. "
"When I entered the kitchen, he nearly knocked over his mug in his haste to "
"stand up and bow! I told him I wanted to make some notes on the Khajiit and "
"asked him if he knew any of the Cat-Folk, as I did not. He said he knew "
"exactly the person I needed and would be delighted to help me, since "
"\"\"that irascible Telvanni\"\" had taken the day off. \n"
"\n"
"I had often passed the seasonal camp of the Baandari Pedlars outside the "
"Market Gate but had never gone in—residual caution from my father's warnings "
"keeping me out, I suppose, as well as the pungent scent. Besides, I've "
"always been a dog person. But Morian plunged right in without hesitation and "
"led me to a pavilion adorned with colorful prayer-flags. I followed Morian "
"into the tent, where he introduced me to Madame Shizahi-jo, whom he said was "
"a Khajiiti sorceress devoted to Azurah and Magrus. Though sitting in lotus "
"position, she bowed politely—the Cat-Folk are lissome—gestured to a pair of "
"seat cushions, and asked how \"\"this one\"\" could be of service. \n"
"\n"
"We had a long and lovely chat. There are superficial similarities between "
"the motifs and designs of the Khajiit and the Redguards, perhaps because "
"they both inhabit hot, arid environments, but where the Redguards favor "
"long, flowing curves, the Cat-Folk are devoted to circular and crescentiform "
"moon-shapes. The shapes of Masser and Secunda in all their phases appear "
"everywhere on Khajiiti clothing and ornaments. The falcate sliver of the "
"crescent moon also brings to mind the Khajiiti claws that spring from pads "
"in their hands and feet, a subtle but ever-present threat to softer folk. \n"
"\n"
"Shizahi-jo made us some tea—sticky sweet, like all Khajiiti food and "
"drink—then asked to see the leaves in the bottom of my cup. She stirred them "
"with her pinky-claw, and said now she saw the object of my concern: I'd let "
"my fear cloud my longing and darken my heart. I blurted something about how "
"Divayth had tried to kiss me, and Morian dropped his cup, splattering poor "
"Shizahi. \n"
"\n"
"I thought he was going to explode in rage, but instead this sad look came "
"over him, and then he began pouring out his heart about his feelings for me. "
"It was so sweet of him. I was really quite moved. The Khajiiti mage made a "
"discreet exit, and we stayed on her cushions, talking, for what seemed like "
"hours."

"When I arrived at Morian's townhouse this morning all was sunshine and "
"rainbows—Divayth and the professor were chatting over mugs of chal like best "
"friends, comparing Ralliballah's Eleven Ritual Forms to the Book of Most "
"Arcane Covenants. I reminded Divayth that he'd promised to escort me to the "
"Yokudan Chapel in the Market District, at which Morian's brow clouded over "
"slightly, but then he smiled and said that was fine, as he wanted to test "
"some new hyperagonal media in his laboratory.\n"
"\n"
"(And maybe it was the light, but to me both men looked … younger, somehow. I "
"must keep in mind that they're both highly capable wizards, which I suppose "
"might include knowledge of illusion magic. Or perhaps I flatter myself.)\n"
"\n"
"I met a number of knowledgeable Redguards at the chapel, all exhibiting that "
"dignity and polite reserve I associate with the better-educated members of "
"that people. The Most-Revered Zirumir, a Priest of Tu'whacca (I hope I "
"spelled that right), was particularly helpful. \n"
"\n"
"As Zirumir pointed out, both the Redguards' ancient home of Yokuda and their "
"current province of Hammerfell are (or were, in the case of Yokuda) deserts. "
"To stay cool, and for protection from the elements, Redguard clothing tends "
"to be light, long and flowing, and these flowing curves are carried into "
"their artisanal designs. Their robes and armor are often accented by flared "
"curves at joints and on headgear. Even their swords tend to be curved.  \n"
"\n"
"In contrast their architecture appears rather heavy, though on close "
"inspection this is mainly for the purpose of insulation from the desert's "
"extremes of temperature. Zirumir showed me the chapel's clever system of "
"louvered ventilation ducts in the clerestory, designed to catch the "
"slightest breeze and funnel it down into the nave. \n"
"\n"
"After Zirumir was called away to tend to one of his congregation, Divayth "
"and I strolled into the apse to view the eight shrines to the Yokudan "
"Divines. Divayth was explaining that whereas the Forebears of Hammerfell "
"often worship the Cyrodilic Divines brought to them by the Reman Empire, "
"these were the traditional gods worshiped by the more conservative Crown "
"Redguards. Suddenly, behind the beehive shrine to Morwha, he turned to me "
"with those blazing eyes, took my hands between his, and told me he thought "
"me the most brilliant and desirable woman in the Imperial City. My breath "
"caught in my throat, and my heart was hammering. But when he moved as if to "
"embrace me I was suddenly frightened—I backed away, shaking my head, then "
"fled out into the nave. I fear I quite startled a young family of Redguards "
"placing candles on Morwha's altar. \n"
"\n"
"Now what? I'm afraid I must have insulted Divayth terribly. How can I make "
"it up to him? And dare I mention it to Morian? Julianos' little teapot, what "
"a dilemma!"

"\n"
"The Arch-Magister at the University, Lady Opel Dantaine, is a Breton, so I "
"consulted with her on Breton motifs. She was friendly, and very helpful. \n"
"\n"
"The Bretons were the last major group of humans on Tamriel to free "
"themselves from their Elven overlords, and in many ways their long vassalage "
"to the Direnni defines their culture. They are fiercely autonomous, each "
"kingdom in High Rock jealous of its individual sovereignty, but Breton "
"society retains a feudal structure that hearkens back to the rank-obsessed "
"Direnni Hegemony. The Bretons are nearly as fractious as their cousins the "
"Nords, but their long tutelage under the Elves makes them open to the "
"magical arts, rather than suspicious of them. \n"
"\n"
"How is this reflected in their arts and crafts? Let's look at Breton armor, "
"for example. The gleaming heavy armor of a Breton knight is as tough and "
"practical as that of a Nord housecarl, but its pleasing form exhibits a "
"subtle sophistication that is reminiscent of Elven elegance. One sees the "
"same influence in Breton weaponry, which is beautiful yet undeniably deadly. "
"\n"
"\n"
"It made me think of the differences between Divayth's Elven urbanity and "
"Morian's breadth of knowledge and all-too-human inconsistencies, even "
"peevishness. Apparently the transliminal experiments have not been going "
"well. When I stopped by the townhouse last night, neither Morian nor Divayth "
"were in—Seif-ij, Morian's apprentice, told me they'd quarreled over the "
"appropriate price to pay a transporting entity to ensure safe return from a "
"jaunt to Oblivion, the remarks became personal, and then my name was "
"apparently brought up. There was shouting, and they both huffed their way "
"out of the laboratory and marched off down Divines Street in opposite "
"directions. \n"
"\n"
"This is terrible. Fighting? Over me? I must confess I was so disturbed I "
"blurted out the whole thing to Lady Opel, who was incredibly kind and "
"solicitous. She asked me if I had feelings for either of the two wizards, "
"and I admitted I did, but they were conflicting and confusing. Opel opened a "
"bottle or two of Bangkorai spiced wine, and we got quite confidential with "
"each other as the evening waned. I'm not sure how I got home, and today my "
"head hurts, but it was worth it, as my heart is no longer so heavy."

"418 to 431)\n"
"\n"
"We come now to the Nords, the first human culture on Tamriel to successfully "
"resist, and even displace, Elven hegemony on the continent. \n"
"\n"
"Not unlike the Bosmer, the Nords rely heavily on stylized, often "
"interlocking natural motifs in their architecture, crafts, and clothing. "
"However, where the Wood Elves' designs are mainly floral, the Nords "
"emphasize animals, in particular the eight \"\"totem\"\" animals of the old "
"Atmoran religion: wolf, hawk, whale, snake, moth, fox, and so forth. They "
"also allow for much more variation of design, to the point where some of the "
"animal motifs are so abstract they are difficult to recognize. Indeed, areas "
"of trim are often filled with interlocking geometric designs that evoke "
"nothing natural at all. \n"
"\n"
"Nord design varies in other ways from that of the Elves as well, in general "
"relying on simple, heavy yet dynamic forms where Elven work would be "
"slender, elegant, and understated. Nothing the Nords make is understated, "
"ever. \n"
"\n"
"This was clear even from outside the Imperial City's Skyrim Embassy, where "
"Morian, Divayth and I had gone to a reception for King Logrolf. The lintel "
"above the embassy doors was crowned with a great iron hawk's-head, its mouth "
"open as if screaming defiance, while the doors were flanked by bas-reliefs "
"of hawks so stylized they looked as much like axes as they did birds. The "
"door itself was dark oak, banded with iron and studded with iron rivets, as "
"if they expected to have to repel an attack. \n"
"\n"
"The inside of the embassy was less martial in appearance, at least once one "
"got past the armed and armored guards inside the door. I wondered if they "
"really needed to wear full helms sporting ram's-horns in order to check the "
"invitations of party guests, but the look in the Nords' eyes didn't exactly "
"invite questions. \n"
"\n"
"The party, as I said, was a reception for King Logrolf, visiting the "
"Imperial City to pay his respects to the Potentate. Morian was there "
"representing the Arcane University; he'd asked me to accompany him and I'd "
"accepted, eager to see our fierce northern cousins in their own environment. "
"When Divayth learned where we were going he'd attached himself to our party, "
"in spite of Morian's baleful glare, but once we were inside the embassy and "
"he was surrounded by loud, boisterous Nords, the Dark Elf wizard seemed to "
"be regretting his decision to join us. \n"
"\n"
"Not so Morian! After he'd downed a flagon of mead, I was suddenly seeing a "
"new Professor Zenas. Attired in his new robe, he positively bloomed, holding "
"forth on the history of magic to an admiring crowd of diplomats, whom he "
"enthralled with tales of the feats of wizardry of the Nord Arch-Mage "
"Shalidor. He seemed twenty years younger, and I suddenly saw him as he must "
"have been in his prime, when he first came to the Imperial City to help "
"found the Arcane University. \n"
"\n"
"Morian even introduced me to King Logrolf, though how he came to know the "
"monarch of Skyrim I have no idea. When I looked around for Divayth, he was "
"nowhere to be seen. Morian and I stayed late at the embassy, quaffing mead "
"and laughing at the Nords' hearty jokes. When we finally left and he walked "
"me home, I thought I could see a new gleam in Morian's eye. \n"
"\n"
"He may have seen the same gleam in mine."

"\n"
"Next we complete our study of the Elves with the Bosmer of Valenwood. Though "
"less influential in the world at large than their cousins the High Elves and "
"the Dark Elves, the Wood Elves outnumber all other Mer in Tamriel, being "
"relatively fecund (for Elves) and more, shall we say, amorously-inclined. \n"
"\n"
"It's a commonplace to point out that the Wood Elves favor natural motifs, "
"but as I learned, there's more to it than that. Their reverence for Y'ffre "
"and the story of the Earth Bones is reflected in the stylized fashion in "
"which these natural motifs are represented. The Bosmer believe that all "
"nature was in chaos before Y'ffre gave all plants, animals, and people their "
"names, which defined the permanent form each species would take. Thus each "
"species is depicted by a particular, idealized motif which represents the ur-"
"form it was given by Y'ffre.\n"
"\n"
"This is reflected in the designs that appear everywhere on Wood Elven arts, "
"crafts, and clothing. These designs are drawn from a large repertoire, as "
"there is a design for each species of plant and animal in the Bosmer's "
"world, but the use and depiction of these designs is culturally prescribed, "
"and there is very little room for variation. Unorthodox usage of these "
"stylized pictograms is considered improper, just plain \"\"wrong.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"This may seem paradoxical in a race whose members otherwise seem so carefree "
"and easygoing, but it is so, as I had an opportunity to see for myself. "
"There are quite a few Wood Elves in the Imperial City, enough that there is "
"a small Bosmeri neighborhood down on the waterfront, served by a tavern "
"called the Tipsy Torchbug. Divayth Fyr, the fascinating Dark Elf wizard "
"assisting Morian Zenas in his experiments, had offered to take me there, and "
"I agreed. \n"
"\n"
"When I arrived at Morian's house on the date of our jaunt to the docks the "
"old professor himself answered the door, and I was surprised when he asked "
"me to step into his study for a moment. Also surprising was the way Morian "
"was turned out: in a new silk robe sporting star-sign symbols, hair trimmed "
"and combed, and smelling faintly of lavender. Quite a transformation from "
"the disreputable, singed and stained robes I'd seen him in previously. \n"
"\n"
"It turned out he wanted to caution me about going down to the waterfront "
"with Divayth Fyr. I'm afraid I laughed, at which he reddened, and I then "
"told him I was a grown woman who could take care of herself. He was somewhat "
"abashed and muttered some excuses, from which I gathered that he was more "
"concerned about my spending time with Divayth than going to the docks. I "
"didn't want his feelings hurt, so I complimented his new robe, at which he "
"beamed, and then I went to the parlor to meet Divayth. \n"
"\n"
"I shouldn't ramble on, but we had a wonderful evening. The Tipsy Torchbug "
"was a lively place, and Divayth introduced me to Lady Biniele, the "
"proprietor, who insisted that we share our table. The entertainment was "
"Biniele's Bosmeri Burlesque, which was hilarious, and though I couldn't "
"drink any of the Wood Elves' revolting beverages, I did consent to share a "
"pipeful of bugsmoke with Divayth, which made me feel strangely exhilarated. \n"
"\n"
"It also led to my seeing a prime example of Bosmeri disdain for \"\"improper "
"design\"\" when a Leyawiin sailor, who'd seen me sharing Divayth's pipe, "
"offered to sell me a carved-bone pipe of \"\"genuine Valenwood make.\"\" "
"Lady Biniele told me it was a counterfeit and not to waste my money. The "
"sailor protested, but the diminutive Wood Elf woman told him any fool could "
"see the tail was wrong on the Imga carved on the bowl, and he should shove "
"off.  Which he did. \n"
"\n"
"Divayth and I shoved off shortly thereafter, and on our way back up to the "
"city gates he pointed to the stars in the brilliant night sky and told me "
"the ancient Chimeri names for the constellations. I must confess, I remember "
"nothing but the warm tones of his resonant voice—and the warm touch of his "
"hand on my arm."

"From the High Elves it is natural to next consider the Dark Elves, as they "
"originated in the Summerset Isles before their migration to Morrowind. Their "
"culture can thus be considered an offshoot of the Altmeri, though in many "
"ways that of the Dunmer is a reaction to that of Summerset rather than an "
"extension. \n"
"\n"
"Also, Morian introduced me to a Dark Elven associate of his, Divayth Fyr, "
"who is helping him on his \"\"transliminal sojourn\"\" project. I don't know "
"what that's all about, but Divayth offered to help me with references on "
"Dunmeri culture, and I accepted. \n"
"\n"
"Elegance is as much a goal for the Dark Elves as it is for the High Elves, "
"but beyond that their styles could not be more different. Morrowind is a far "
"harsher environment than fair Summerset, and that rigor is reflected in "
"Dunmeri designs. The Dark Elves also draw on nature for their inspiration, "
"but in place of avian and floral motifs, Dunmeri artifice draws on the "
"curved and spiky forms of the carapaces of the giant insects that inhabit "
"Morrowind. Elegant these are, but also fearsome, a constant reminder that "
"the Dunmer daily fight for their very existence. \n"
"\n"
"Ebony is the favored metal for Dark Elven heavy armor, but even in their "
"lighter armors and shields, steel and steel alloys are often lacquered in "
"dark tones to appear ebony-like. Clothing, armor included, is often accented "
"by flaring extensions at shoulder, crest, or hip, with overlapping geometric "
"designs that may have been borrowed from Dwarven culture, though Divayth "
"bristled at the idea of any Dwemeri influence on the Dunmer. \n"
"\n"
"In truth, I find the dark sorcerer from Vvardenfell exerts a strangely "
"compelling attraction. He doesn't seem old, but he referred to Morian, who "
"is at least sixty, as a \"\"young man.\"\" I wonder how old he really is. In "
"fact, I wonder many things about him. He has those crimson eyes that seem to "
"look right through you. It's a little bit thrilling. \n"
"\n"
"He's offered to take me with him to visit a Bosmeri tavern down on the "
"waterfront. I may do it."

"\n"
"This series will provide a survey-level overview of the symbolic and "
"stylistic hallmarks that distinguish the major cultures of Tamriel in their "
"arts and crafts. Our focus will be on the portable durable goods of the "
"various races, that is, their clothing, ornamentation, arms, and armor, as "
"these reliably reflect personal cultural expressions. When completed, this "
"series will support the curricula of the introductory ethnographic courses "
"at the Arcane University. \n"
"\n"
"We begin with the High Elves, the reclusive Altmer of the Summerset Isles, "
"because the argument can be made (and often is, by Elves) that civilization "
"in Tamriel was brought here by the Aldmeri of Old Ehlnofey. Insofar as the "
"Elves of Summerset consciously strive to maintain the heritage of their "
"Merethic ancestors, their traditions are certainly closer to those of pre-"
"First Era society than any other. \n"
"\n"
"This is not to say that, in the thousands of years since the arrival of the "
"first Aldmeri, the culture of the High Elves has not deviated and ramified "
"in many ways, because it has. It is simply that, by viewing modern Altmeri "
"culture with the eye of a historian, we can perceive the outlines of its "
"origins. \n"
"\n"
"In this initial effort I have benefited from the advice of the celebrated "
"Morian Zenas, Professor of Transliminal Studies here at Arcane University. "
"Professor Zenas is the only member of our faculty who has visited the "
"Summerset Isles, specifically Artaeum, with a brief stop in transit at Dusk. "
"\n"
"\n"
"I was a bit intimidated when I first visited Professor Zenas in his house in "
"the Cathedral District, but I found him a charming old gentleman, "
"undeserving of his reputation for peevishness. Morian (for so he asked me to "
"address him) bade me stay for dinner, which was served by his laconic "
"Argonian apprentice, Seif-ij Hidja. \n"
"\n"
"As Morian explained, the High Elves strive for a simple elegance in their "
"designs, in which flowing lines reflect graceful forms from the natural "
"world. More-or-less abstract birds, flowers, and sea shells are common "
"motifs, rendered in rich but muted colors. Armor will be tooled or embossed "
"to represent scales or feathers, and even heavy cuirasses and helmets may "
"sport stylized wings or beaks. \n"
"\n"
"Metallic items are often accented with a translucent greenish material "
"called \"\"glass.\"\" This is a sort of jade-like obsidian that Elven smiths "
"have learned to work by secretive processes known only to the Altmer. Though "
"rigid enough to take a superb edge when cool, glass can be made malleable "
"enough to assume almost any form, and the High Elves use it extensively on "
"ornamental arms and armor. \n"
"\n"
"After dinner, over snifters of Cyrodilic Brandy, Morian asked me all sorts "
"of questions about my motifs project, and about myself. It was really very "
"flattering. I must find an excuse to talk with him again."
