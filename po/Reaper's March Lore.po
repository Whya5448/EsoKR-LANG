"\n"
"This unit will begin occupation of Arenthia within a fortnight. To ensure "
"our success in the operation, every soldier needs some knowledge of the city "
"and its civilians. Go in unprepared, and you'll end up robbed blind or stuck "
"full of Wood Elf arrows without knowing how or why. Having spent some years "
"guarding caravans in transit from Arenthia to Skingrad, I can provide the "
"information you need to avoid personal harm and unnecessary provocation of "
"the citizenry.\n"
"\n"
"Don't be lulled into complacency by the familiar buildings; this city is "
"nothing like home. Though some Colovian traders from north of the River "
"Strid have settled here, they're outnumbered by the Wood Elves from the "
"south and the Khajiit who roam in from the eastern savannas. In the past, "
"the city's allegiance has changed as often as the wind, but the flimsy "
"Khajiiti hovels and the Elves' temporary tree-shaping don't endure like the "
"good Colovian stone from which most of the lasting structures are built.\n"
"\n"
"You'll encounter plenty of Wood Elves and Khajiit, so a general awareness of "
"their customs and practices will prove useful. Wood Elves become "
"unreasonably aggressive if they believe a plant or tree is in danger. If any "
"trees need to be cleared, obtain permission from your superior and assemble "
"an armed squad. Also, be aware that Wood Elves are fond of indulging in "
"drink, and their normally irreverent tongues become even worse when soaked. "
"A word of advice: do not engage in drinking contests with these Elves, no "
"matter how they taunt you.\n"
"\n"
"Khajiit make up a sizable portion of the population, though few hold "
"permanent residence here (or anywhere). These moon-worshipers drift in and "
"out in bands, bringing their sugary liquors and garish fabrics to market. "
"Exercise caution if you are approached by one of the pleasure-partners that "
"often travel with these caravans. They are invariably thieves, and by the "
"time you realize you've been picked clean, they'll be halfway back to Dune.\n"
"\n"
"On a related note, we've caught wind that a ring of skooma smugglers may be "
"operating out of the city's shamefully disused Temple of the Divines. This "
"is an affront to the Divines and will be investigated once our hold is "
"established. We will clear out the scum if the rumors prove true, but there "
"is to be absolutely no looting of the Temple. In time, we will restore it to "
"its rightful glory.\n"
"\n"
"Your job is to make certain that our grip on Arenthia is ironclad. Enforce "
"martial law and keep the peace as much as possible, but be swift to quell "
"any potential disturbance. Remember, no culture can claim "
"\"\"traditional\"\" ownership of this city; it belongs to the banner with "
"the most troops on the ground, and that's going to be ours."

"\"\"I stifled my gasp at the Mer's impertinence, to even suggest that he "
"would be worthy to fight with those of us who had trained so hard. To my "
"surprise, the archpriest agreed, adding the name Taren Omathan to the roster "
"at the beginners' level. I was eager to whisper the news to my fellow elite "
"students, but my first bout was scheduled to begin in a few minutes' time.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I fought eighteen competitions in a row, besting all. The crowd gathered "
"in the arena knew of my prowess, and gave polite, unsurprised applause at "
"the end of each fight. As much as I focused on my own battles, I could not "
"help noticing that other competitions were receiving more and more attention "
"in the arena. The spectators whispered among themselves, and more began "
"drifting away to see something that was evidently more spectacular and "
"unusual than my unbroken string of victories.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"One of the most important lessons we teach from the Two-Moons Dance is "
"the lesson of rejecting one's vanity. I understood then the importance of "
"achieving a personal synchronicity with one's body and mind, of rebuffing "
"outside influences of no importance, but I admit I had not accepted the "
"lesson in my heart. I knew I was good, but my pride was hurt.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"It came down to a contest of champions, and I was one of the two. When I "
"saw who the other fighter would be, my mood turned from one of wounded "
"dignity to complete disbelief. My adversary was the servant, Taren.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"It must be a joke, or some final philosophical test, I reasoned. Then I "
"looked into the crowd, and saw anticipation of a great battle to come in "
"every eye. We gave one another the sign of respect, I stiffly and he with "
"great elegance and modesty. The fight began.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Initially, I sought to end it quickly, still thinking that he was "
"unworthy to be cleaning the arena, let alone fighting in it. In retrospect, "
"I was being illogical, as I must have known he had bested as many students "
"as I had to reach that final level. He offered simple counterblows to my "
"attacks, and responded in kind. His style was expansive, encompassing "
"sophisticated arcane foot play one moment and simple jabs and kicks the next."
" I tried assailments intended to dazzle, but his face never showed either "
"fear or contempt of my abilities.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The fight lasted a long time. I don't recall when I realized I was "
"destined to lose, but when it ended, I was not surprised by the outcome. "
"With a sense of unusual and true modesty, I bowed to him. But I could not "
"resist asking him as we left the arena to the sound of thunderous applause "
"how he had so secretly grown to become a Master.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"'I never had a choice to rise in the Temple,' Taren replied. 'Every day, "
"I cleaned the training chambers of the elite classes and then the beginners'."
" So you see, I never had the misfortune to forget those early mistakes, "
"lessons, and techniques while observing and learning the ways of the Masters."
"'\n"
"\n"
"\"\"He left Torval early the next morning to return to his homeland, and I "
"never saw him again, though I've heard people say that he's become a priest "
"and a teacher. I became a teacher as well, for children just beginning their "
"training in the Two-Moons, as well as the elite. And I make certain to bring "
"my best pupils to see the how the unlearned fight, so that they might never "
"forget.\"\""

"\n"
"The Temple of Two-Moons Dance in Torval has for many hundreds of years been "
"the finest training ground in all Tamriel for warriors of foot and fist. The "
"masters teach students of all ages from all parts of Tamriel the most "
"ancient techniques and the most modern variations, and many a former pupil "
"has graduated to great fame. I myself trained there, and as a young child I "
"remember asking my first master, Zoaraym, which former student he felt had "
"best learned the lessons of the Temple.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I was not a teacher when I met this man, but a student myself,\"\" he "
"said, smiling in reminiscence, his great wrinkled face becoming even more "
"like the withered fruit of the bathrum tree. \"\"This was long ago, before "
"your parents were born. For many years I had trained at the Temple, rising "
"to study in more difficult and demanding classes taught by the wisest and "
"most learned Masters of the Two-Moons Dance.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Gi'Nanth, you will come to understand that the tempering of your body "
"must attend the tempering of your mind, and there is a prescribed order of "
"training we at the Temple have designed over the years in concordance with "
"the way of Riddle'Thar. I had reached the highest level, where my power and "
"skill were such that even by supernatural, magical means, few could ever "
"best me in weaponless combat.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"There was a servant at the Temple at the time, a Dunmer a few years "
"older than myself and those in my class. We had never noticed him but in "
"passing over the years, for he would enter the training chambers quietly, "
"clean for a few minutes' time, and leave without saying a word. Not that we "
"would have listened if he spoke, so enwrapped were we in our exercises and "
"lessons.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"When our last Master told some of us, myself included, that the time had "
"come for us to leave the Temple or become teachers, there was a great "
"festival of celebration. The Mane himself deigned to visit and observe our "
"ceremony. As we were and are a temple of philosophy and combat, there were "
"contests of debate and competitions in the Temple's war arena, not only "
"among the elite few, but open to all students.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"On the first day of the festival, I was examining the gladiatorial "
"roster to see who I would fight with first, when I heard a conversation "
"behind me: the servants speaking to the archpriest of the Temple. It was the "
"first time I heard the Dunmer's voice, and the first time I heard his name.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"'I understand you wish to rejoin your people's struggle in Morrowind, "
"Taren,' the archpriest was saying. 'I am sorry to hear it. You have been an "
"institution here for many, many years, and you will be missed. If there's "
"anything I can do for you, please name it.'\n"
"\n"
"\"\"'Thank you for your kindness,' the Dunmer replied. 'I do have a request, "
"but I fear you would be loath to grant it. Ever since I first came to the "
"Temple, I have been watching the students learn, and practiced myself when "
"my duties allowed for it. I know I am but a servant here, but I would be "
"honored if you would allow me to compete in the war arena.'\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I stifled my gasp at the Mer's impertinence, to even suggest that he "
"would be worthy to fight with those of us who had trained so hard. To my "
"surprise, the archpriest agreed, adding the name Taren Omathan to the roster "
"at the beginners' level. I was eager to whisper the news to my fellow elite "
"students, but my first bout was scheduled to begin in a few minutes' time."

"A wife. A husband. A son or daughter. Mother or father, aunt or uncle: each "
"of us has lost one or more of these. It has touched every family in Elsweyr, "
"the dreadful epidemic, the terrible plague—the Knahaten Flu.\n"
"\n"
"It started in Senchal, on Sweet Street in the Black Keirgo slums, among the "
"skooma-struck. At first the city elders dismissed it as a toxin in the "
"goods, but then it spread to Dagi's Pride and Squint-Eye, and was reported "
"from the docks in Alabaster as well. \n"
"\n"
"And suddenly, it was everywhere: Torval, Orcrest, Dune, Corinthe, and all "
"points in between. The Winds of Khenarthi bore the coughing and retching to "
"every ear. We seemed to be witnessing the Death of Cats on Nirn.\n"
"\n"
"Slowly, Elsweyr began to fight back against its doom. Clan Mother Mizaba-ko "
"of Corinthe first identified how the flu spread from Khajiit to Khajiit. "
"Rathuni-la Dawnwhisker, a Daughter of Azurah from Riverhold, distilled a "
"sorghum-tea that mitigated the worst of the symptoms. Even I contributed, "
"organizing the remnants of the Mane's Legion to maintain order and put this "
"new knowledge to use. \n"
"\n"
"But it was not enough. Everywhere, Khajiit were dying, by the litter, by the "
"pride, by the entire tribe. The Moon Bishops read the portents, and they "
"were dire indeed.\n"

"the western waves came the Elves of Summerset, bringing physicians, healers, "
"desperately needed supplies.\n"
"\n"
"And one more thing: hope. Hope that Elsweyr would survive.\n"
"\n"
"At first, many Cats were suspicious. Never before had the haughty High Elves "
"helped the Khajiiti—why now? But their canonreeves passed among us, as if "
"unafraid of the flu, and explained: the Altmer did it not from friendship, "
"but from policy. We needed their help now, and they would need our help "
"later. Invaders were coming to southwest Tamriel, they said, and the High "
"Elves could not repulse them without Khajiiti claws at their side. \n"
"\n"
"To fight against mutual enemies—ah, that was a logic we Cat-Folk could "

"the Wood Elves, and gradually the Knahaten Flu began to recede. And when "
"Queen Ayrenn of Alinor proposed the alliance treaty of the Aldmeri Dominion, "
"we took plume in claw and signed it. \n"
"\n"
"Now, fellow Khajiiti, we have been through the forges of torment, and with "
"our new allies, we emerge stronger than ever. We welcome the chance to test "

"\n"
"You don't need to know my real name—not sure I remember it anymore, anyhow. "
"My auntie left me a shack on a hill south of the border. Never thought about "
"it much, until I lifted Hrol's Golden Girdle from the Temple of the One. "
"Suddenly life got real complicated, and I decided it was time to go claim my "
"inheritance.\n"
"\n"
"Auntie—let's call her Auntie Alias, no point in telling you too much—was an "
"Imperial Border Scout, part of the cohort stationed at Fort Sphinxmoth, in "
"the hills between Elsweyr and northern Valenwood. In the late days of the "
"Second Empire the job of the Border Scouts was to keep the quarrelsome "
"locals in line so as not to interfere with trade. \"\"Free trade, by "
"Aless,\"\" auntie would say, opening another bottle of Surilie Farms and "
"winking. \"\"Lifeblood of the Empire!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Now the Scouts couldn't stop every little cross-border vendetta, but they "
"did prevent the Cats and the Runty Elves from engaging in wholesale "
"slaughter, and kept the bandits off the road from Dune to Arenthia. Auntie "
"liked the climate, so when she retired she bought this little plot, came "
"down and put up her hut. It's bigger than it looks, by the way—goes way back "
"into the hill, and you can bet auntie dug out a back door, just in case.\n"
"\n"
"By the time I got here, one dark night in Sun's Dusk, with the wound in my "
"thigh leaking blood again after that wild ride on the stolen horse, the "
"Border Scouts were long gone, and the Dawnmead Marches had returned to their "
"natural state: just one law shy of anarchy. And that one law was the Law of "
"Revenge.\n"
"\n"
"It was the Vinedusk Wood Elf tribe versus the Dakarn Khajiiti clan, and it "
"was a near-continual war of cross-border raids and midnight murders. They "
"took turns occupying the ruins of Fort Sphinxmoth, sending out bands to "
"waylay merchant caravans, raid villages and towns, and pay off old scores. "
"Neither side noticed me hiding in the old shack during daylight, and "
"slipping from shadow to shadow around the Marches after dark. The place was "
"a killing ground—I could hardly go five hundred paces without encountering a "
"dead warrior, a half-empty cart, or a slain merchant. \n"
"\n"
"It was a looter's paradise. \n"
"\n"
"Ah, those were the good times. Too good to last, I suppose—eventually the "
"Vinedusk bandits overreached and staged a raid on Arenthia itself, right "
"about the time the Dakarn Cats tried to take over organized crime in Dune "
"and the Thizzrini Arena. The respectable citizens on both sides of the "
"border formed militias or hired mercenaries, swept the hills clean, and that "
"was the end of brigandry in the Marches. The Vinedusk tribe actually "
"reformed as a Bosmeri irregular unit, the \"\"Vinedusk Rangers\"\" (Ha!), "
"while the surviving Dakarns became the nucleus of the Duneguard Outwalkers. "
"The border settled back down, and the Lifeblood of the Empire resumed its "
"flow.\n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, I was there to recognize opportunity when I saw it coming down "
"the road from Dune, laden with trade goods. By the next Fredas I was in "
"Bravil, looking up a few of my old contacts. Half a season later it was me "
"and the newly-dubbed Murkwater Gang who were occupying good old Fort "
"Sphinxmoth, digging out the barracks, sharpening our blades, and repairing "
"the old traps. \n"

"Colovian Estates, as Decreed by the Count of Skingrad and Ratified by the "
"Elder Council of the Empire of Cyrodiil. The Legion of the West Weald, under "
"command of General Lavinia Axius, has been given the Honor of Annexing the "
"South Weald and Securing its new Borders. \n"
"\n"
"OPPORTUNITIES IN THE WEST WEALD LEGION\n"
"\n"
"Be It Further Known that, upon Cessation of Hostilities in the South Weald, "
"members of the Occupying Legion will be Mustered Out and Granted Land—Farms "
"for Soldiers, Estates for Officers. Previous Ownership of all said Lands has "
"been declared Null and Void by the Elder Council. Current Squatters will be "
"Deported or Indentured and put to Useful Labor on behalf of the New Owners.\n"
"\n"
"GLORY, ADVENTURE, AND PRIZE MONEY\n"
"\n"
"Serve in the South Weald and earn the Plaudits of a Grateful Colovia! "
"Consider also that after Previous Conflicts, many freeborn Colovians were "
"able to enter the Lower Nobility by virtue of the Copious Ransoms elicited "
"from the Families of Important Prisoners. This may be the Best Chance for "
"Advancement in this generation—don't miss out due to Fretting, Timidity, or "
"Trivial Entanglements."

"By Moon Bishop Hunal\n"
"\n"
"NEW:\n"
"To speak of the dark gambol of the dro-m'Athra.\n"
"\n"
"WAX:\n"
"When true cats die, their souls are lifted by Khenarthi and flown to the "
"Sands Behind the Stars, to play and prey until the Next Pounce. \n"
"\n"
"When bent cats die, their souls are dragged down by Namiira into the Dark "
"Behind the World, to serve the Heart of Lorkhaj until their tails are "
"straight. \n"
"\n"
"FULL:\n"
"These, then, become the Dancers in the Darks, where they whirl to no music "
"but the beating of the Heart. Sometimes these dancers seep up through the "
"cracks in Nirni to the moonlit world, and walk among us as if made of "
"moonless night. Then we call them dro-m'Athra. And this is a name of fear.\n"
"\n"
"For a true cat to see a dro-m'Athra do the Bent Dance is to feel his tail "
"twitch in time, and feel the pull of the Darks. As each twitch pulls the "
"true cat further from the moons-light, the cat's shadow grows longer and "
"more bent. And if the tide of the Darks grows greater than the tide of the "
"Lights, the true cat is lost, and becomes a bent cat. \n"
"\n"
"Then comes the true peril, for a dro-m'Athra can twist out a bent cat's "
"soul, and send it through the cracks to the Darks. Once it hears the beating "
"of the Heart it, too, will dance bent. \n"
"\n"
"It is hard to stop. One night all the villagers of Lohrn were found dancing "
"the Bent Dance. Now we do not go there.\n"
"\n"
"WANE:\n"
"To banish the dro-m'Athra, there are two ways: the Way of Jone and the Way "
"of Jode.\n"
"\n"
"Warriors use the Way of Jone, which is to unsheathe the claws and strike the "
"darkness until it is no more. And this way is a good way, for everyone who "
"is strong of heart and claw can use it.\n"
"\n"
"Priests use the Way of Jode, which is to bathe the moonless dark in bright "
"lunar light. And this way is a better way, for bent spirits thus banished do "
"not return."

"Attributed to Clan Mother Ahnissi\n"
"\n"
"A hairless scholar came from his desert to ours and said, \"\"I want to know "
"the truth about the Khajiit.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And the Clan Mother said, \"\"Only one? You are not very curious, hairless "
"scholar.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The hairless scholar peered at the Clan Mother through little windows on his "
"nose and said, \"\"I want to know about your different breeds. Is it true "
"that what phase of the moons you are born under determines your physical "
"morphology?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And the Clan Mother said, \"\"Indeed, hairless scholar. I was born as Jode "
"was waxing and Jone was new, so I am an Omhes-raht. My daughter here was "
"born when Jode was waxing and Jone was full, so she is a Senche-raht. Thus "
"we are nothing alike.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The scholar peered at mother and daughter and said, \"\"You look very much "
"the same to me.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And the Clan Mother said, \"\"I have heard that those with round pupils have "
"poor vision. It is a sadness.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The hairless scholar tapped his chin and said, \"\"I want to know about your "
"so-called Lunar Lattice. Is it true that the phases of the moons regulate "
"every aspect of your lives?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And the Clan Mother said, \"\"Indeed, hairless scholar. Today is Suthay, "
"when Jode is new and Jone is new, and we never stir the stew winter-shines."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The hairless scholar blinked and said, \"\"You mean withershins, or "
"retrograde? But that is exactly the way you're stirring your soup.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And the Clan Mother said, \"\"But only from above. Perhaps your eyes only "
"let you see things from one direction? That is a sadness.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The hairless scholar adjusted his nose-windows and said, \"\"All right. Fine."
" Tell me of the Two Moons Dance. Is it true you Khajiit dance at the "
"midnight hour to the light of the moons?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And the Clan Mother said, \"\"Indeed not. We dance the Two Moons Dance in "
"every hour. It is our delight.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The hairless scholar said, \"\"You're not dancing. You're sitting by the "
"fire. Tell me when you're going to dance, so I can join you.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And the Clan Mother said, \"\"My daughter and I dance to the moons at this "
"moment, but you cannot join us, for you do not have a tail. It is a sadness."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The hairless scholar gnawed his knuckle and said, \"\"Very well then. I hear "
"that you have curious beliefs about the moons. Tell me of them.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And the Clan Mother said, \"\"As you wish. When Lorkhaj made a place for "
"Nirni's children, the darkness in his heart made it also a prison. So his "
"heart was cut out and buried deep in Nirni, and his body was hurled to the "
"moons but could not pass them, for it did not know the First Secret. Thus is "
"his body the Dead Moon in the Lunar Lattice. See it, just there?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The hairless scholar peered at the sky and said, \"\"I see no moons at "
"all—Masser and Secunda are both new. What do you mean?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And the Clan Mother said, \"\"Hairless scholar, this one forgot again about "
"your eyes.\"\" And she sighed, and her tail danced, and she shrugged. And "
"she said, \"\"It is a sadness.\"\""
