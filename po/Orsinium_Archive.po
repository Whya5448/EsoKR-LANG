"King Torug, founder of the original city of Orsinium, possessed a powerful "

"The Vosh Rakh wear masks and that's all right by me. I'd rather keep my name "

"that her methods included frequent beatings, endless repetition of key "

"Trinimac.\n"

"A Discourse on Faith by Ugdorga, the King's Scribe\n"
"\n"
"For generations, Orcs have believed in three constant truths: the "
"stronghold, the grudge, and the fury of Malacath. But before Malacath, at "
"least according to certain traditions and a few noted scholars, there was "
"Trinimac. Today, the city of Orsinium reverberates with the intellectual "
"debate and reverent faith of both sides of the argument: Who is the true god "
"of the Orcs?\n"
"\n"
"For traditionalists, there is no question. Malacath is lord and god. He "
"personifies the Sworn Oath and the Bloody Curse. His portfolio includes "
"conflict, battle, broken promises, and anguish. Everything an Orc feels "
"concerning his or her place in the world comes from the Furious One. The "
"Orcs see themselves as a people betrayed, and Malacath reinforces this "
"belief. For Malacath, clans must stand powerful but alone in their ancestral "
"strongholds. The strongest rules and weakness is cast out with extreme "
"intolerance.\n"
"\n"
"Clan chiefs such as Chief Bazrag, who oppose the idea of an Orsimer king, "
"hold to the teachings of Malacath.\n"
"\n"
"For the new Orsimer, Trinimac is the culmination of their dreams and desires."
" The warrior god personifies culture and civilization. He calls for unity, "
"not discord; for strength, not malicious chaos. He stands for unifying the "
"Orsimer. For elevating us above our baser nature and making us equal to the "
"other races.\n"

"A Study of Death Rites of the People of Tamriel\n"
"By Chaplain Jorden, Priest of Arkay\n"
"\n"
"As a devout follower of the god of burials and funeral rites, I have "
"dedicated my life to the study of the ceremonies and rituals performed by "
"the various races of Tamriel when it comes to the deaths of their leaders, "
"family members, and loved ones. In this volume, I explore the death rites of "
"the Orsimer—otherwise known as the Orcs of Wrothgar.\n"
"\n"
"Popular lore would have us believe that an Orc's remains lay where they fall."
" While there is a grain of truth in this concept, Orcs know as much about "
"disease and decay as any of the other intelligent races. No one wants a "
"rotting corpse left around to stink up the place, and rotting corpses "
"attract all kinds of insects and predators. So, while the spot where an Orc "
"dies is marked and considered almost sacred by his brethren, the body is not "
"left in place for more than a few hours. During this time, friends and "
"family come by to pay their last respects. Then the body is removed—to "
"where, I cannot say.\n"
"\n"
"Orcs, for all their oral traditions, refuse to provide explanations or "
"specifics to outsiders. I have had to make educated guesses based upon "
"observations and the few conversations I've been able to engage in. But so "
"far, no one will tell me what the Orcs do with the bodies of the dead.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I discovered an ancient Orcish burial site, the mountain known as Sorrow. "
"This snow-covered peak, full of dangerous creatures and deadly weather, "
"served as a depository for dead Orcs for several generations, though the "
"practice ended abruptly sometime in the past. Apparently, the mountain was "
"reserved for only the bravest and strongest Orcs, who were required to climb "
"as high as they could before death finally overtook them. These Orcs were "
"left where they fell, but stones were piled atop their bodies to form "
"protective cairns or unique constructions called wedge tombs.\n"
"\n"
"This also appears to have some connection to the practice of marking any "
"location where an Orc dies and falls with a sacred rock. They call the rocks "
"\"\"tumnors,\"\" which I believe means \"\"death stones\"\" in the Orcish "
"tongue.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I finally found an old Orc female who was willing to share some of their "
"death rituals with me. Specifically, she was willing to discuss the practice "
"of \"\"beshkar-nor,\"\" the death-forge.\n"
"\n"
"Apparently, what happens to the bodies of Orcs of great stature—leaders, "
"heroes, and revered elders—is that they undergo a process known as the death-"
"forge. The old Orc described the process in confusing terms. I'm not sure if "
"the blood is drained from the body and saved for later use or if the entire "
"body is burned and reduced to ash, and then the ash is saved. Either way, "
"the saved remains wind up mixed into molten metal, allowing the revered Orc "
"to become one with a powerful tool or weapon, usually a sword, hammer, or "
"shield.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"So, my quest to completely understand the complex funerary rites practiced "
"by the Orcs of Wrothgar continues. I've learned so much, but I realize I "
"haven't really learned anything at all. I know, as a general rule, the Orcs "
"don't bury their dead—except when they do, such as on the mountain of Sorrow."
" I know that they mark the place where a powerful Orc died, but they "
"probably don't actually leave the body there to rot and decay. And I learned "
"that some portion of a dead Orc is saved to mix with a newly forged tool or "
"weapon in a process known as the death-forge.\n"
"\n"
"I'll continue to probe and investigate, for I find these contradictory "
"practices to be fascinating. I just hope I don't anger the wrong Orc and "
"learn about their death rituals first hand. That wouldn't do at all."

"There is a creature in the land of the Orcs that defies explanation. The "
"chub loon has no purpose and little known history. However, it is delicious "
"when cooked with moon-sugar glaze and citrus.\n"
"\n"
"I, Zabia-ko, and several companions sought to secure trade with the Orcs of "
"Fharun Stronghold when we found ourselves on the wrong side of the "
"negotiations. We had little choice but to run for our lives when the chief "
"burned our ship and sent warriors after us. The cold and rocky coast "
"overlooking the frigid Sea of Ghosts became our home for the night. The "
"howling sea wind bit deep into our fur. Despite that, sleep eventually came "
"in the dark of the night.\n"
"\n"
"As the sun rose over the Druadach Mountains, a cacophony of honking sounds "
"broke the rhythmic peace of the waves against the rocks. The others feared "
"some unknown beast had come to eat us, but curiosity overcame this one, and "
"she slipped out of her bedroll, grabbed her staff, and moved toward the "
"coast to let her eyes decide if we should stay or flee. Of all the creatures "
"that have passed before Zabia-ko's eyes, none are stranger than the stub-"
"legged, waddling birds that swarmed the ice floes and rocks. They stood in "
"groups, clumping for warmth, with their useless wings flapping at their "
"sides. Their call, once frightening, sounded comical when I looked upon them."
"\n"
"\n"
"The birds were nothing like anything in the old and well-worn wilderness "
"guide I borrowed from the library back home. Escape through the Friendship "
"Gate could wait. This was something new, and new things have value. At first "
"we were very careful to gather a few of the creatures, but we soon learned "
"that they were too stupid to flee from a Khajiit. They had no trouble "
"fleeing from Orcs, though! Any proper prey should try to run away when "
"Khajiit walk among them, but not these flightless birds. We scooped them up "
"and made haste for the gate, lest the Fharun clan catch our scent and give "
"chase.\n"
"\n"
"This one's first stop in Wayrest was to the Mages Guild. A few pieces of "
"gold gained me access to their natural history library, where a new edition "
"of the wilderness guide was prominently displayed. It mentions the chub loon "
"as an elusive creature that was not observed by earlier writers. How could "
"such an obnoxious creature be overlooked?\n"
"\n"
"This one spent several days and candle-lit nights going over every tome on "
"the creatures and wildlife of Tamriel. Not a single mention of the chub loon "
"exists before the beginning of the second era. How could that be? The very "
"first mention is in a text on the horker, and it only says that they were "
"moving in on the horker habitat, disrupting the food source. Could it be "
"that, like the Nords and other men, they came from another land? Could the "
"stupid birds have been brought here by travelers from Atmora? Could they "
"have traversed the Sea of Ghosts on their own with only floating chunks of "
"ice to carry them? In any case, no matter how they arrived, they secured a "
"new habitat, flourishing on Wrothgar's rocky coast."

"\"\"You have no ghost, my dearest friend. The culprit is, in fact, Palwin "

"\n"
"Investigator Vale's words echoed off the walls as the crowd gathered in the "
"library around Lady Mandrake gasped. Heads turned in all directions, seeking "
"the accused. In the back of the room, the blacksmith stood nervously. A look "
"of utter guilt spread across his face even as he shook his head from side to "
"side.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"What are you talking about? There was no way a mere mortal could have "

"a locked room and murder the butler? How could I hide the body when I was in "
"my forge the entire time? You have no evidence, wench!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The room fell silent as all eyes once again turned to Investigator Vale. The "
"insult didn't seem to faze her in the least. Her eyes sparkled in the "
"flickering candlelight as she drew back her shoulders and tilted her chin up "
"slightly so that her raven hair fell across her back. The fingers of her "
"right hand, curled into a tight fist, seemed to clutch something. She made a "

"reveal a shiny bronze key in the shape of a skull.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Oh, you have once again underestimated me, dear Palwin,\"\" Vale said. "
"\"\"The evidence is clear as the nose on your face. You were the only one "
"who had access to this skeleton key, the one lost by the lord of Mandrake "
"Manor!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Palwin's eyes widened. He stumbled over his words before collecting himself, "
"Then he said, \"\"You … you don't know that was mine. How did you even get "
"it? I … wait. You used me!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Vale's head rolled back as a joyous laugh erupted from her long, elegant "
"throat. \"\"Oh, you silly little man! Of course I used you! Those drinks we "
"shared last night? I added a tincture to yours that allowed me to search "
"your rooms after you fell into a deep sleep. It was then a simple matter for "
"me to see exactly what was out of place.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Vale, now moving about the room and playing to her audience, continued. "
"\"\"Scratches on the floor by the bookshelf clearly revealed evidence of a "
"hidden door. Gloves casually tossed in a corner, stained with blood. Boots "
"caked with grass from the forest where the bodies were found. And this key, "
"sitting on your nightstand for anyone to see.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"What does any of that prove, except that you drugged me?\"\" Palwin "
"cried.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"It proves everything,\"\" Vale said happily. \"\"Instead of a ghost, we "
"have a disgruntled blacksmith who wandered the tunnels beneath the manor. "
"Tunnels that could only be accessed with this key. What started as a scheme "

"Gull-koo loves her briar hearts! She's an interesting old bird, that "
"hagraven. Since coming to the old Breton fort, my job among the Winterborn "
"has been to assist Gull-koo, doing whatever the hagraven needs in order to "
"make sure the briar hearts grow and thrive. Strange things, those briar "
"hearts. Kind of like large fruits, but also kind of like the heart of some "
"large animal. Or man.\n"
"\n"
"Today I got to see the process up close. It starts with a corpse. The "
"Winterborn prefer to use the corpse of an enemy, but the hagravens have no "
"such compunctions, Any corpse will serve their purposes, whether an Orc, "
"Winterborn, or even a harpy. Once a corpse is procured, it is purified in a "
"strange ritual of the hagraven's own devising and place in a specially "
"prepared plot of soil. Then, with great reverence and fanfare, the hagraven "
"adds the briar heart seed to the planted body.\n"
"\n"
"Spells and blood serve to feed and water the macabre garden, and soon the "
"first sprouts begin to bloom from the corpse. The sprouts quickly grow into "
"saplings, which in turn grow into small trees. These small trees connect "
"through a system of roots back to the large tree the hagravens and tree "
"tenders care for in one of the fort's courtyards. I believe that the sapling "
"trees contribute to the health and overall power of the large tree, but my "
"questions on the subject were ignored by Gull-koo and the other hagravens.\n"
"\n"
"Meanwhile, briar heart fruit blooms on the saplings and the large tree "
"alike, beating a haunting cascade that echoes throughout the fortress. Once "
"the fruit ripens, it is ready to be transplanted. And that's where our own "
"warriors come into the picture. In most cases, when a Winterborn warrior "
"falls in battle, a hagraven can bless the warrior with a ripe briar heart. "
"The magical process plunges the briar heart into the fallen warrior and "
"returns the warrior to life, granting him or her additional strength and "
"fortitude as befits a briar-heart warrior.\n"
"\n"
"Now, I haven't yet been privy to the process, but I believe there's also a "
"way to implant the briar hearts into living warriors. I've seen the cages "
"where some of our most-powerful and loyal warriors have gone to meditate and "
"prepare themselves for elevation to briar-heart warrior status. Perhaps, if "
"Gull-koo agrees, they'll allow me to accept such an honor. I'll let you know "
"how it turns out.\n"

"An Informal Study\n"
"By Folms Seleth\n"
"\n"
"What is the fascination the typical Orc has with his (or her) own tusks? I "
"swear, if they aren't constantly polishing or sharpening the damn things, "
"they're studying them in whatever reflective surface is at hand or looking "
"longingly at the tusks of their neighbors. And when they're not doing these "
"things, they're talking about their tusks like they were royal heirlooms or "
"ancient relics that were almost magical in nature. Let me tell you, it's "
"enough to drive this Dark Elf a bit mad!\n"
"\n"
"While I supposed it would be rude to just come right out and ask an Orc "
"about this obsession with all things tusk related, I decided that making a "
"study of how the word and concept of the tusk was used in everyday Orc "
"speech could help me reach some level of understanding. The first Orc I "
"approached about the subject, a young female who I'll call \"\"Orcah,\"\" "
"made an angry face—at least, I think it was angry; I find it difficult to "
"tell the difference when it comes to the countenance of the average Orc—and "
"told me in an angry voice to \"\"tusk off!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"What an odd expression, I thought. \"\"Tusk off.\"\" Simple, declarative. It "
"means almost nothing, but as it emerged from Orcah's mouth, I knew exactly "
"what she wanted me to do. I departed quickly, making my apologies in great "
"haste even as she was reaching for the axe hanging at her side.\n"
"\n"
"This got me to thinking about other Orcish expressions that contained the "
"ubiquitous word. For example, \"\"By Malacath's tusk!\"\" This seems to be "
"an all-purpose exclamation that substitutes the proper noun with any of a "
"multitude of famous or infamous Orcs. I've heard Orcs swear by the tusks of "
"Malacath, Trinimac, Kurog, Bazrag, Forge-Mother Alga, Urtho the Flatulent, "
"and even hearth-mothers and ancient ancestors that no one but the Orc making "
"the exclamation even remembers. And for variety, the forsworn tusks might be "
"chipped, cracked, broken, missing, pierced, or any of a myriad of shades and "
"colors. \n"
"\n"
"Another expression I hear over and over in the Orsinium taverns, \"\"Better "
"than a kick in the tusks,\"\" seems to imply that one unpleasant experience "
"is somewhat less agreeable than another unpleasant experience. When one Orc "
"says to another, \"\"I heard you fell into a pond full of leeches,\"\" her "
"companion exclaims, \"\"Yeah, but it was better than a kick in the "
"tusks,\"\" I can only conclude that no matter how horrible an ordeal an Orc "
"suffers, there could always be something worse. I suppose that an Orc's "
"tusks are extremely sensitive and a kick must instill in them unbearable "
"pain. Or, it's just something to say and you can't really infer anything "
"deeper from the conversation. Orcs can be so confusing.\n"
"\n"
"But this is just the tip of the tusk, as it were. Spend a few hours in an "
"Orc tavern and you'll hear all kinds of expressions involving tusks. "
"\"\"Tusk you!\"\" \"\"Who gives a tusk?\"\" \"\"You tusking idiot!\"\" "
"\"\"What the tusk?\"\" \"\"Stop tusking around!\"\" \"\"Tusk me!\"\" And "
"perhaps my favorite, \"\"Go tusk yourself,\"\" which at first glance seems "
"to be an impossible request, but I've seen what an Orc tusk can do to flesh "
"and blood. An Orc must really dislike the person he or she offers this "
"fierce suggestion to.\n"
"\n"
"I decided to make one more attempt to get an Orc to discuss the topic of "
"tusks with me. This time I chose a striking young female who was seated by "
"herself in a dark corner, making her way to the bottom of a bottle of "
"Orsinium pink zinfandel. I asked if she'd be willing to talk about the many "
"uses for the word \"\"tusk\"\" in the Orcish vocabulary. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"Tusk no!\"\" she told me in no uncertain terms. Nevertheless, I pressed "
"the issue. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"Are you tusking kidding me?\"\" she asked. When I assured her I wasn't "
"\"\"tusking kidding her,\"\" she balled up her fist and knocked me on my "
"arse.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Tusk!\"\" I exclaimed. And I finally understood the true meaning of the "
"word."

"The Orcs are strong people, fierce and warlike. Blood is our birthright, and "
"the sinews of Malacath knit around our bones. But we were not made to sit "
"still. We were not made to settle and till the land, but to move, to "
"pillage, and to plunder. Our strength is to destroy. We reap the glory of "
"war from what we destroy. That is the only crop we need!\n"
"\n"
"But many years ago, Torug, first among the Orcs in strength and rage, came "

"They built the city into the rock, a shiny gem. Orsinium. And it was a great "
"city, but Orcs were not made to live in cities. Its walls, designed to "
"defend, only trapped us. Its threefold gates sealed us in. The city was a "

"Redguard and Breton peoples came to destroy it.\n"

"We did not flee because we feared war. We fled to meet the enemy and we cut "

"O Glory! O Joy! To be Orcs again! Free and on the move!\n"

"It was not to last. The enemy mustered their forces in number far exceeding "

"Upon applying Master Sterone's Goblin-stench formula, the Riekrs seem to "
"have accepted me into their number. They are very social creatures, with "
"each Riekr expected to do his part. \n"
"\n"
"I have been assigned the task of smashing rocks with a hammer. I have yet to "

"other rock-breakers, who have taken to the task with gleeful cackling.\n"
"\n"
"Day 2\n"
"\n"
"More rock-breaking. I fear I have pulled some kind of muscle in my forearm.\n"
"\n"
"Day 3\n"
"\n"
"Further observation of the Riekr social structure reveals a strange attitude "
"toward magic and its practitioners. Being creatures of limited intelligence, "
"they lack the kind of formal training in magic that one sees in other parts "
"of Tamriel. They make up for this through an innate connection to the magic "
"of the world, so to speak.\n"
"\n"
"When a Riekr demonstrates a connection to magic, he is immediately shunned "
"by his brothers. They throw stones, such as the ones we broke when I first "
"joined the clan, to drive him off. The mage must then flee into the "
"wilderness or face certain death. After a period of exile, the Riekr mage "
"buys his way back into the clan with an offering of food, such as freshly "
"slain deer, bear, or echatere.\n"
"\n"
"After that, the mage is elevated into a revered member of the clan, suddenly "
"gaining power and influence with the Riekr chief.\n"
"\n"
"Day 5\n"
"\n"
"The mages have gathered in a council and the signal has been given for a "
"migration. It seems a new food source has been located.\n"
"\n"
"Day 6\n"

"We have arrived in a cavern filled with food crates. It is clear this was "
"some encampment, though I have yet to see the owners.\n"
"\n"
"Day 7\n"
"\n"
"One of the Riekrs found a book among the crates. He asked me what it was. It "
"appeared to be a book of recipes. I told him as much and he eagerly took a "
"bite out of it.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Recipes no taste good,\"\" he said and spit the book out.\n"
"\n"
"Day 8\n"
"\n"
"My rock-breaking has not kept pace with my fellow Riekrs, and I'm afraid the "
"others are starting to look upon me with suspicion. The Riekrs do not take "
"kindly to those who can't pull their own weight. I should probably leave "
"soon, before I am completely found out."
