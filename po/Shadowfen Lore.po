"\n"
"Background:\n"
"How this disease began and spread is a mystery. By gathering information, I "
"hope to resolve the issue.\n"
"\n"
"Argonians appear immune to the flu. This has caused conjecture that they "
"actually introduced the flu to retaliate for years of slavery at the hands "
"of the Dark Elves. These claims have never been proven or disproven, and "
"they require more research.\n"
"\n"
"Mitigation:\n"
"Methods that slowed the rapid spread of the flu included burning the "
"belongings of infected people (which, unfortunately, sometimes including "
"burning remaining family members); segregating the sick into ghettos (or "
"walling them up); or putting the diseased onto ships and setting them adrift."
" Normal curative spells and elixirs were inconsistent in their ability to "
"cure the flu. \n"
"\n"
"Symptoms and Course: \n"
"General malaise, loss of appetite, and fatigue begins several hours before "
"an afflicted victim develops other symptoms. The afflicted person's eyes "
"water constantly. Skin develops a bright red granular rash that does not "
"itch. \n"
"\n"
"Within twenty-four to thirty-six hours, victims suffer nosebleeds, their "
"tears contain blood, and a granular rash spreads over their bodies. At this "
"point, victims develop a deep, raspy cough. Within thirty-six to forty-eight "
"hours, the victims' coughs produce bloody phlegm. \n"
"\n"
"In most cases, death takes place in as little as seventy-two hours after the "
"initial onset, but some victims have lingered for five to seven days.\n"
"\n"
"Treatment: \n"
"When the Knahaten Flu first spread, it seemed unstoppable. No reliable "
"treatment against it has ever been proven.\n"
"\n"
"Ten years ago, a young Redguard named Perizada claimed she'd had a vision "
"from the Divines. She replicated the cure from this dream, testing it on a "
"village scheduled to be razed (together with its inhabitants). Her cure "
"worked, and the village was saved.\n"
"\n"
"The cure required clannfear claws boiled in salt water. The patient would "
"then drink the liquid. The increased trade of actual and purported clannfear "
"claws on the black market caused prices to soar wildly. So many false cures "
"had proven fatal that Perizada's cure was never officially sanctioned. As "
"Perizada later died of the flu herself, its efficacy was eventually "
"considered dubious at best.\n"
"\n"
"The \"\"Clannfear Cure\"\" has given rise to many other supposed cures, all "
"of which involve boiling something in a liquid and then drinking the result. "
"For the poorest of the population, chicken broth proved not only cheap, but "
"easily obtained. It typically soothed their coughs, which in turn allowed "
"patients to breathe more easily. \n"
"\n"
"Chicken broth is definitely not a guaranteed cure, but it is certainly the "
"most accessible. It is recommended, should this dread disease ever return.\n"
"\n"
"As the granular skin rash was non-irritating, many left it untreated. Those "
"whose rash remained covered—whether in bandages, poultices, or simply "
"clothing—seemed less likely to infect those who attended them. This also "
"accounts for the much slower spread of the disease in colder climates and "
"during winter months.\n"
"\n"
"Have you heard of other cures? If so, please submit your reports directly to "
"me for further investigation."

"발병:\n"
"이 질병이 어떻게 시작되고 퍼졌는지는 미스테리다. 나는 정보를 수집함으로써 이 문제를 해결하고자 한다.\n"
"\n"
"아르고니안들은 독감에 면역이 있는 듯하다. 이 사실은, 그들이 자신들을 수년간 노예로 부린 다크엘프들에게 복수하고자 독감을 전염시켰다는 "
"억측을 불러일으켰다. 이런 주장들은 그동안 입증되지도 논파되지도 않은 바, 더 많은 연구가 필요하다.\n"
"\n"
"완화:\n"
"독감의 급속한 확산을 늦추는 방법으로는 감염된 사람들의 소지품을 태우는 것(불행히도, 때로는 나머지 가족 구성원들을 태우는 것도 "
"포함된다); 환자들을 격리구역으로 분리하는 것(혹은 벽안에 가두는 것); 혹은 환자들을 배에 태워 떠내려보내는 것 등이 있다. 일반적인 "
"치유 주문과 비약은 독감을 치유하는 데 일관된 효험을 보이지 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"증상 및 경과:\n"
"전신권태, 식욕 상실, 피로감은 환자에게 다른 증상들이 나타나기 몇시간 전부터 나타난다. 감염된 사람은 끊임없이 눈물을 흘리며, 피부에는 "
"가려움을 동반하지 않는 선홍색 두드러기가 생긴다.\n"
"\n"
"24시간에서 36시간 사이에 환자는 코피를 흘리고, 눈물에 피가 섞여나오며, 두드러기가 온몸으로 퍼지게 된다. 이 시점에서 환자는 깊고 "
"거친 기침을 한다. 36시간에서 48시간 사이에는 환자가 기침할 때 피섞인 가래가 나오게 된다.\n"
"\n"
"대부분의 경우 빠르면 최초 발병으로부터 72시간 후에 사망하지만, 일부 환자의 경우 5일에서 7일까지 버티기도 한다.\n"
"\n"
"처방:\n"
"나든(Knahaten) 독감이 처음 퍼졌을 땐 막을 방법이 없다고 여겨졌다. 그것에 대한 신뢰할 만한 처방은 아직 입증된 바가 없다.\n"
"\n"
"10년 전, 페리자다라는 젊은 레드가드가 디바인들로부터 계시를 받았노라 주장했었다. 그녀는 그 꿈에서 본 치료법을 본따, (주민들 째로) "
"밀어버릴 예정이었던 마을에서 실험을 벌였다. 그녀의 치료법은 효과가 있었고, 그 마을은 구원받았다.\n"
"\n"
"그 치료법이란 클랜피어 발톱을 소금물에 우려내어, 환자에게 그 국물을 마시게 하는 것이었다. 암시장에서 진짜, 혹은 가짜 클랜피어 발톱의 "
"거래량이 증가하면서 가격이 폭등했다. 범람하던 수많은 가짜 치료제들이 치명적인 결과를 불러일으켜, 페리자다의 치료법은 결코 공식적으로 "
"인가받지 못했다. 훗날 페리자다 본인도 독감으로 죽었기 때문에, 그 효능은 결국 기껏해야 의심스러운 것으로 여겨지게 되었다.\n"
"\n"
"\\\\\"\\\\\"클랜피어 치료법\\\\\"\\\\\"은 수많은 대중요법을 탄생시켰는데, 이 치료법들은 모두 액체에 뭔가를 우려낸 "
"결과물을 마시는 식이었다. 극빈층에게 닭 육수는 값이 쌀 뿐만 아니라 쉽게 얻을 수 있는 것이었다. 그것은 보통 그들의 기침을 "
"진정시켜주었고, 결과적으로 환자들이 더 편하게 숨을 쉴 수 있게 해주었다.\n"
"\n"
"닭 육수는 확실히 입증된 치료법은 아니지만, 가장 쉽게 접근할 수 있는 치료법임은 확실하다. 이 공포스러운 질병이 언제든 돌아오게 된다면 "
"추천할 만 하다.\n"
"\n"
"피부에 난 두드러기는 놔둬도 큰 지장이 없었으므로, 많은 사람들은 그것에 별다른 조치를 하지 않았다. 두드러기를 감싼 사람들의 "
"경우ㅡ붕대를 감든, 습포를 붙이든, 아니면 단순히 옷을 입든 간에ㅡ 접촉한 사람들에게 전염시킬 확률이 낮은 것으로 보인다. 이것은 추운 "
"기후와 겨울철에 전염속도가 훨씬 느린 것 또한 설명할 수 있다.\n"
"\n"
"혹시 다른 치료법에 대해 아는 바가 있는가? 만약 그렇다면, 부디 연구의 진척을 위해 나에게 바로 알려주기 바란다."

"Hefting another bale into the loft, Maakul felt the pain shoot through his "
"shoulder once more. He rotated his shoulder, shrugging to release tension.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Thanks for your help,\"\" the Argonian trader said. He nodded at the "
"Kothringi and lumbered away with his cart.\n"
"\n"
"For several months, the same trader came to Zuuk bearing loads of hay for "
"the horses. Maakul's brother Huug, before he died, had handled the "
"transactions. He arranged deliveries, unloaded the bales, and made payments. "
"Then the illness struck Huug: a rash that stood out as bright spots against "
"his skin together with a high fever. Within a week, he was gone.\n"
"\n"
"And now, Maakul dealt with the trader. If only his muscles didn't hurt so "
"much. Clearly, he lacked the strength of his late brother. He'd need to try "
"harder, though he preferred studying and reading to any physical labor.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I need to check the ledgers anyway,\"\" Maakul said to himself as he "
"headed into his hut. He'd let the books go during his brother's illness, and "
"the latest delivery should be entered.\n"
"\n"
"As he opened the payment register, a slip of paper fluttered to the floor. "
"He recognized his brother's handwriting and picked it up.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Beware the ruby necklace.\"\" \n"
"\n"
"Maakul frowned. They couldn't afford necklaces, much less rubies. What did "
"his brother mean? Shrugging, Maakul threw the crumpled note into the brazier "
"beside his desk, draped a cloak over his legs, and settled down to bring "
"their accounts up to date. He felt so cold.\n"
"\n"
"That night, Maakul saw his reflection in his wife's concerned face. She'd "
"found him, coughing and shivering at his desk. She half-carried him to bed. "
"A line of red welts, the tell-tale rash, encircled his throat.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Rubies,\"\" he mumbled, clawing at his skin as the Knahaten Flu claimed "
"its latest victim."

"Gold exchanged hands, marking the deal complete. Makes-Many-Waves belonged "
"to a new master.\n"
"\n"
"Sendrasa Llarys watched as her newest acquisition joined the group she'd "
"already purchased. She stared so long at Makes-Many-Waves that she drew the "
"Argonian's eyes to hers. They both looked away quickly, almost instantly. "
"Eye contact between master and slave would be punished by ten lashes.\n"
"\n"
"The distance between market and house was no more than seven miles, but it "
"seemed an eternity to Sendrasa. She'd counted the years impatiently until "
"she could set up her own household and bring Makes-Many-Waves home.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Send the rest to the field house,\"\" Sendrasa said. Her footman "
"assisted her from her horse. \"\"I want that one,\"\" she waved a hand "
"towards Makes-Many-Waves, \"\"brought to my sitting room. She'll be my "
"personal assistant.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"As you wish, madam.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Pulling her gloves off as she strode into her home, Sendrasa laughed. "
"\"\"Finally, yes! It will be exactly as I wish.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"How long since she'd felt her lover's lips pressed against hers? Shared in "
"desperate, guilty caresses whenever they could steal away together? How "
"she'd suffered once their intimacy became known! As though, Sendrasa thought "
"bitterly, seeing her beloved sold through the Archeins hadn't been "
"punishment enough.\n"
"\n"
"Time passed with deadly slowness from that moment until Sendrasa finally "
"located Makes-Many-Waves and bought her back. This time, no one could "
"separate them. They belonged together.\n"
"\n"
"The door opened, and Makes-Many-Waves stepped forward, eyes downcast "
"becomingly. Sendrasa walked past her, shut and locked the door, then turned.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I've missed you,\"\" she said softly.\n"
"\n"
"In a moment, they locked in a passionate embrace, Sendrasa touching Makes-"
"Many-Waves's scales gently, searchingly.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Did they torture you, darling? I swear they'll pay!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Makes-Many-Waves shook her head, her frilled spine fluttering. \"\"Seeing "
"you heals me, my love. But the Archeins ….\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You're safe. Those traitors won't touch you again,\"\" Sendrasa said.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Listen, my love,\"\" Makes-Many-Waves said. \"\"Your parents paid the "
"Archeins very, very well. Their eyes are everywhere. They'll know you bought "
"me, and they'll come for me.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I'll free you,\"\" Sendrasa replied. \"\"You'll be safe!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"It's not like that,\"\" the Argonian whispered. \"\"The Archeins don't "
"care whether Argonians they sell are free or not. To live together safely, "
"we must leave Morrowind. \"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I see. Now kiss me.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"As darkness approached, Sendrasa and Makes-Many-Waves began their journey, "
"heading northwest toward the border with Skyrim.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Is Riften safe?\"\" Makes-Many-Waves whispered. They'd traveled several "
"days out of their way to shake off any possible followers.\n"
"\n"
"Before Sendrasa could speak, an arrow pierced her throat. She clutched at it "
"with one hand, her eyes widened in surprise. More arrows followed swiftly, "
"killing the Dark Elf long before she slid to the ground.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You're free now,\"\" said an Argonian archer, stepping from the shadows.\n"
"\n"
"Makes-Many-Waves stared at him, unable to speak or move.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Did she hurt you?\"\" he asked, coming closer. \"\"You can return to "
"Black Marsh now. You're no longer a slave.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Collapsing across Sendrasa's body, Makes-Many-Waves sobbed."

"When he could no longer move, Scale-Song bowed his head, listening to the "

"He would return to the Hist. How embarrassing, though, for an Argonian to "
"suffocate in mud.\n"
"\n"
"His eyes opened suddenly. He'd had the same dream every night for weeks. "

"\"\"I'll try,\"\" said Scale-Song, \"\"but I never remember it's a dream "
"until I'm awake.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Gash-Tail reached into an earthenware jar on the shelf beside him. He handed "
"Scale-Song a thick roll of leaves tied with twine.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Burn this,\"\" he said. \"\"The incense may clear your mind. If the Hist "
"wants you, you must listen.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Scale-Song nodded. Advice like this was precisely why he sought Gash-Tail's "
"help. For the first time in a long while, he couldn't wait for night to fall."
"\n"
"\n"
"The burnt incense filled his hut with thick gray smoke that coiled heavily "
"along the ground like fog. Scale-Song hadn't expected it to smell so "
"horribly. Still, he watched the smoke spread slowly throughout the room, his "
"eyelids growing heavier and heavier.\n"
"\n"
"A cave. A tunnel? Smoke drifted along the muddy floor. Scale-Song stopped "
"running and reached out a hand toward the smoke. Talk. Ask. Speak.\n"

"\"\"Are you trying to tell me something?\"\" he asked aloud.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I am dead.\"\"\n"

"\"\"Dead? Who are you?\"\"\n"

"\"\"It? What is it?\"\"\n"

"It seemed like hours before the pair reached the tunnel's exit. The "
"shimmering figure sighed deeply, pointing toward a shriveled tree.\n"
