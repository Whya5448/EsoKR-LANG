"With the Circle of Captains' decree that each ship's crew should go forth of "
"its own accord, making its own legend, the crew of the Fallowfire rejoiced. "
"They yearned to bring the fear of Men to new lands of the Mer that had not "
"yet been put to the sword. They took to heart their Lord Ysgramor's words to "
"\"\"Give no quarter. Show no kindness.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"A pyre upon the shore was raised for the Fallowfire. The ashes of their "
"beloved vessel fell upon the waters and drifted toward Atmora, cutting all "
"ties with their homeland. Led by Captain Gurilda Sharktooth, the crew of the "
"Fallowfire turned their backs to the sea and strode inland.\n"
"\n"
"South they traveled, seeking lands untrammeled by others of Ysgramor's crews."
" South and south they went, sowing the blood vengeance demanded by Ysgramor. "
"No Mer escaped their axes once seen, no settlement remained unburnt in their "
"path. Truly the Fallowfires brought their lord's wrath to bear upon the "
"treacherous Elves. As they journeyed, so the terror of them grew among the "
"Mer.\n"
"\n"
"Gurilda led her crew to the foothills of a lofty range of mountains. These "
"they named Ysgramor's Teeth and long they sought a pass through them. When "
"finally a way was found, the crew crossed over and into a new land. \"\"The "
"Rift\"\" they called this region, for it was riven by deep canyons and swift-"
"flowing rivers. In the name of Fallowfire, their lost Companions, and Yngol, "
"they scoured the land, burning Mer villages and putting all they encountered "
"to the axe.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the Mer offered battle. The cowardly Elves gathered in great "
"numbers high atop a rocky hill, daring Gurilda's Companions to attack. And "
"so they did. Challenges were offered, brave deeds were done, and heroes made."
" Battle raged through the day and as the sun touched the peaks of the "
"western mountains, the Mer broke and fled. Gurilda lay dying, pierced by a "
"multitude of weapons, but lived until sunset. Her spirit ascended to "
"Sovngarde knowing her crew was victorious.\n"
"\n"
"That day, the dominion of Elves over the Rift was ended. The Companions "
"claimed the land in the name of Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, and made it "
"free to all Nords. To honor their dead, the Companions labored long, delving "
"into the hillside to craft a tomb. Gurilda was buried there, with all her "
"weapons and armor. There too were placed the remains of Bergitte the "
"Toothless and Kajord Eagle-Eye, laid alongside Gurilda as they had fallen in "
"battle, defending their captain. Others of the honored dead were entombed as "
"well. A mighty cairn of stone was erected around the tomb entrance, to "
"forever mark the grave.\n"
"\n"
"Vikord One-Ear, long Gurilda's first mate but now captain, gazed long upon "
"the hills rising about them and the valleys at their feet. This was a land "
"he could love, where his people could prosper and grow. He decreed the "
"crew's wandering at an end and caused a great hall to be built on the battle "
"site. Thus was Fallowstone Hall created, in homage to the ship that carried "
"them to these shores. From this time, the days of the Companions of the Rift "
"are counted. Never may their glory fade!"

"Fallowfire의 선원들은 각 배들은 각자 스스로 앞으로 나아가 자신들의 전설을 만들어야한다는 선장의 명령에 기뻐했다. 그들은 아직 "
"칼이 꽂히지 않은 머의 새로운 땅에 인간의 두려움을 가져오기를 갈망했다. 그들은 로드 이스그라모르의 “양보를하지말라, 친절을 보이지말라."
"”라는 말을 마음에 새겼다.\n"
"\n"
"해변에 있는 불이 Fallowfire를 위해 올려졌다. 그들의 아끼는 배의 재는 물에 떨어지고 아트모라, 그들의 고향과 연결된 끈을 모두 "

"신뢰할 수 없는 엘프들에게 안겨주었다. 그들이 여행을 하면서, 그들에 대한 공포는 머들 사이에서 커져만 갔다.\n"
"\n"
"구릴다는 대원들을 이끌고 높은 산맥의 기슭으로 향했다. 그들이 이스그래모르의 이빨이라고 이름지은 그 산들을 지나갈 방법을 그들은 오랫동안 "
"찾았다. 마침내 방법을 찾았을 때, 선원들은 그 산을 지나 새로운 땅으로 들어갔다. 그들은 이 지역을 깊은 협곡과 빠르게 흐르는 강으로 "
"갈라졌기 때문에 “균열”이라고 불렀다. Fallowfire의 이름, 그들의 잃어버린 영웅들 그리고 인골의 이름아래 그들은 땅을 샅샅이 "
"뒤지고 머의 마을들을 불태우고 마주친 모든 것들에 도끼를 마주쳤다.\n"
"\n"
"마침내 머들은 전투를 제의했다. 겁많은 엘프들은 바위언덕 꼭대기에 엄청나게 모여 구릴다의 동료들을 대담하게 공격려했고 또 그렇게 했다. "
"도전들이 이어졌으며, 용감한 일들이 벌어졌으며, 영웅들이 만들어졌다. 전투는 하루종일 격렬하였고 태양이 서쪽 산봉우리에 닿자 머들은 "
"패했고 도망쳤다. 구릴다는 수많은 무기들에 꽂혀 죽어가고있었지만 해가 질때까지 살아있었다. 그녀의 영혼은 그녀의 선원들이 승리를 가진 "
"것을 알고 손븐가드로 올라갔다.\n"
"\n"
"그날, 균열에 대한 엘프드르이 지배는 끝이 났다. 동지들은 우리 모두의 전령인 이스그래모르의 이름으로 땅을 얻었고, 모든 노드를 위해 "
"자유롭게 하였다. 그들의 죽음을 기리기위해 동지들은 무덤을 만들기 위해 산비탈을 파고들어가며 오랫동안 일을 했다. 구릴다는 무기와 갑옷을 "
"모두 갖추고 그곳에 묻혔다. 또한 베르기테 투스리스와 카조드 이글아이의 유해가 놓여있었는데 그들은 전투에서 쓰러졌을 때처럼 구릴다와 "
"나란히 누워 그들의 선장을 지켰다. 다른 명예로운 전사자들 또한 무덤에 눕혀졌다. 무덤 입구 주변에 거대한 돌덩어리가 세워져 영원히 "
"무덤을 표시했다.\n"
"\n"
"오랫동안 구릴다의 1등 항해사였던 비코드 원-이어가 지금은 선장이 되어 그들의 주위에 솟아있는 언덕들과 그들의 발치에 있는 계곡들을 "
"오랫동안 응시하고 있었다. 이곳은 그가 사랑할 수 있는 그의 민족이 번영하고 성장할 수 있는 땅이었다. 그는 선원들의 방황을 끝내고 "
"전투지에 거대한 홀을 짓게 하였다. 그래서 Fallowstone Hall은 그들을 이 해안으로 운반한 배에 경의를 표하기 위해 만들어졌다."
" 이 때부터 균열의 동지들의 날들이 꼽아진다. 그들의 영광은 결코 사라지지 않을 것이다."

"At last Sinmur was brought to bay. Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, boldly led "

"combat. The giant-kin proved willing, roaring his defiance and leaping to "

" Wuuthrad sang a blood song as it chopped into the club, breaking it asunder "

"Sinmur howled his rage and hurled the stub of his once-fearsome weapon at "
"Our Lord Ysgramor's head. He grappled Ysgramor, seeking to squeeze life away."
" A roar of laughter was the answer the monster received. Ysgramor's forehead "

"A song of death and delight keened from Wuuthrad as Ysgramor buried it deep "

"There's a reason I was kicked out of Daggerfall, chased out of Elden Root, "
"and banned from Mournhold. I've tried every variety of intoxicant, wine, "
"ale, and Argonian swill this world has to offer. I've sampled skooma with "
"Khajiit, licked an Argonian Hist Tree, and hunted \"\"magical\"\" toads with "
"the Bosmer.\n"
"\n"
"None of that compares to Nord mead. There's nothing like it.\n"
"\n"
"The purest stuff is made in Nord villages, but we're at war with the Nords, "
"and a Breton has no guarantee of surviving a trip like that. Leave that sort "
"of thing to the professionals. There is still hope, however. If you're ever "
"at a tavern, and there's a cask of Nord mead, you'd be a fool to pass it up.\n"
"\n"
"Mead is made by fermenting honey and water (though a few recipes call for "
"molasses). Sometimes, you add grain mash and strain it, but that isn't "
"necessary. Some of the High Elves call it \"\"honey wine,\"\" but mead needs "
"more than good honey. Every meadery has its own recipes. After you drink "
"enough mead, you learn the names of the brewmasters who create them. A drunk "
"Nord will gladly punch another in the face over the honor of a good "
"brewmaster. Then again, a drunk Nord will punch anyone for just about "
"anything.\n"
"\n"
"Every brewmaster has a distinct blend of spices, fruit, and sometimes hops "
"(which makes a mead bitter, which makes some Nords bitter, too). I've even "
"heard tales of mead mixed with the blood of heroes, allegedly granting them "
"the words of a poet or skald. I'd like a mead named after me, but I'm not "
"going to bleed for it.\n"
"\n"
"An Altmer once told me that brewing is the basis of all culture. It's why "
"our ancestors started farming and forming cities. It's what we do when we've "
"got too much wheat and barley and hops and we're sick of farming. The "
"culture of drinking seems to be what keeps Nords together.\n"
"\n"
"Nords must be really sick of farming, because they brew and drink prodigious "
"amounts of mead. Whenever a cask of really good mead is opened, Nords gather "
"round because they know that cask won't last long. But if you don't know how "
"to behave in the Nord drinking culture, you'll end up broke, broken, "
"hungover, and helpless. I found out the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Nords love to drink. But more than that. Nords respect those who can endure "
"adversity. I know that sounds flowery for explaining why two drunk Nords "
"would have a \"\"hit-me-hard-in-the-face\"\" contest, but really, that's why "
"their culture celebrates getting drunk.\n"
"\n"
"A Nord can gain respect by consuming more mead than anyone else, just as "
"he's respected for surviving a blizzard or killing a bear with a sharp stick."
" \"\"Nord honor\"\" is something they talk about endlessly when they're "
"drunk, and even more when they're sober. So the first thing you learn about "
"Nords is if you want their respect, never turn down a drink. It's a test. If "
"you can't handle that next drink, leave. Otherwise you'll wake up somewhere "
"they find hilarious, but you won't be laughing.\n"
"\n"
"Nords also love their skalds. Songs and stories go over well with a drunk "
"audience, once they've had enough of brawling, boasting, and throwing axes "
"at each other. Their songs are all about how they're better than everyone "
"else at everything. They've all heard these over and over again, so bring "
"some of your own. They're desperate to hear something new.\n"
"\n"
"Anywhere you go, drinking is also a good way to redress a mistake or make an "
"apology, and it's the same with Nords. If you lose a contest, you need to "
"buy a drink. If you make a mistake or offend someone, you need to buy a "
"drink. If you're insulted, stand there and take it, then you need to buy a "
"drink.\n"
"\n"
"You don't have to be the best brawler around to survive a room full of "
"drunken Nords. You can also impress them by being clever or by being "
"talented, but you better be really good. When it's time to take a punch in "
"the face, you better be ready for a punch in the face. If you don't like "
"getting punched, there are some things you should never talk about, like "
"politics, who's the best brewmaster, and who punches the hardest. And never "
"demand to know why someone just punched you in the face.\n"
"\n"
"If you want to hear more, buy me a drink the next time I'm in Daggerfall. "
"I'll tell you a story."

"When I was a lad, I stood at the eastern edge of Skyrim and looked upon "
"Morrowind. From Stendarr's Beacon, I could see the Red Mountain of "
"Vvardenfell, but I never ventured there. Like many Nords, I was content to "
"leave foreign lands to the foreigners.\n"

"A scant ten years ago in 2E 572, my father took a different path. He fought "

"\n"
"And now? War rages across Tamriel. Khajiit and Bosmer war against Dunmer and "
"Argonians. Altmer strike against Skyrim. And from High Rock, the Daggerfall "
"Covenant attacks us all.\n"
"\n"
"In the midst of such chaos, what choice do we have? Our alliance with the "

"over our foes, fighting with Dunmer and Argonians beside me.\n"

"The Pact never ceases to surprise me. I have spoken at great length with "
"Argonian mystics, marveling at their view of the world. I have walked into "
"the caves of Dunmeri priests, staring at shadows as they tell me tales of "
"their gods.\n"
"\n"

"Argonians, and Nords. We will triumph under the banner of our Pact, "
"steadfast allies who can never be defeated."

"선원들은 이스그래머에게 먹고, 자랑하고, 마시기를 권했다. 5백명의 컴패니언들 중에서도 주요 인원들이 내륙으로 떠났기 때문이다. 이야기가 "

"우쓰라드밖에 없었다. 그가 말한바에 따르면, 이 전설적인 도끼는 가장 암울한 날 밤에 만들어졌다. 바로 눈물의 밤이었다. 이스그래머가 "
"앉은 채 수평선을 훑어보았다. 그는 탐리엘에서 벗어나 아트모라의 해변으로 향하는 그의 부대 마지막 배에 탑승했다. 배에서 가장 시야가 "
"넓은 위치에서 그는 처음 세웠던 도시 사아쌀이 불타는것을 지켜보았다. 부풀어오른 하늘은 불꽃과 바다에 비를 쏟아냈다. 그리고 우리 중 "
"가장 위대한 자는 쓰디쓴 눈물을 흘렸다.\n"
"이스그래머는 슬픔이 너무 큰 나머지,  소금기 있는 눈물 대신, 순수한 흑단같은 눈물을 흘렸다. 그의 큰 아들인 잉골은 술잔에 그 눈물을 "
"모으고 그의 아버지를 따뜻하게 안아주었다. 잉골은 선도자의 위대한 목에 맥주를 흘려넣었고, 선도자의 위대한 어깨를 모피로 감쌌으며, 그를 "
"갑판 아래 해먹에 억지로 밀어넣었다.\n"
"그 후에 잉골은 작업을 시작했다. 우리 선도자의 큰아들 잉골은 우리들이 아는 한 가장 솜씨좋은 대장장이였다. 그렇게, 바다위에서, 잉골은 "
"자신의 작업을 시작했다. 잉골은 번개를 이용해 밤의 눈물을 데웠고, 바다의 너울로 그것을 식혔으며, 일어나는 돌풍과 합주하듯 망치소리를 "
"울렸다.\n"
"이스그래머가 그 다음날 아침 일어났을때, 잉골은 그에게 어젯밤 그를 몸져눕게 만든 슬픔으로 벼려낸 위대한 도끼를 선물했다. 그리고 "
"이스그래머는 그의 아들을 껴안았다. 그는 기쁨, 슬픔, 분노로 울부짖었다. 그리고 사아쌀에서 나온 마지막 배 위에서, 이스그래머는 그의 "
"도끼를 우쓰라드, 아트모라의 언어로는 \\\\\"\\\\\"폭풍의 눈물\\\\\"\\\\\"이라는 뜻의 이름을 지었다.\n"
"그 부분을 이야기 하던 중, 이스그래머는 이야기를 멈추었다. 우리의 선도자는 하락의 선원들과 함께 폭풍우 도중에 잃은  잉골의 이름을 "
"부르짖었다. 장남이며 가장 큰 기쁨을 주며 항상 함께하던 그의 아들,  잉골을 위해서. 이스그래머가 말했다. 폭풍의 눈물을 만든 자는, "

"The town of Riften offers intriguing opportunities for the enterprising "
"rogue, though hidden quicksands lurk as well. The Rift has little fertile "
"ground for our endeavors and Riften is the only locale I can recommend for "
"even a brief visit.\n"
"\n"
"Once in town, a base of operations can be established at the Withered Tree "
"or Shadehome Inn; both cater to the discerning traveler. A casual perusal of "
"the town will yield several prospects, but I erect the spine of warning. All "
"scouting must be circumspect, with purchase of an item from one of the "
"town's many merchants. For the town guard are active and unusually "
"suspicious of strangers, especially those not of the Nord race. A meandering "
"walk, without a local purchase in hand, will quickly land one in a cell.\n"
"\n"
"The island that forms the heart of town, surrounded by the invigorating "
"waters of the nearby lake, contains several merchant stalls. A quick "
"purchase there will soothe the guards' suspicions. And it affords a glance "
"at the merchants' goods. These vary greatly in quality and selection, so the "
"stalls of greatest interest I leave to each to determine for himself.\n"
"\n"
"To the north are two buildings of note. Two merchant families of long "
"standing sell wares not generally available in the island stalls. The "
"Rothalens sell crafting materials, including a few very specialized and rare "
"items. This Dunmer family is tolerated in Riften for the glamor their wares "
"add to the otherwise mundane town. The Rothalens, like all Dunmer, are "
"grasping and suspicious, employing an unfortunate number of guards and more-"
"esoteric security measures. The claw of greed should be tempered with the "
"hiss of caution here.\n"
"\n"
"Next to the Rothalens is the establishment of Guram Ironarm. This retired "
"blacksmith and his family cater to the weaponsmithing and armorer crafts. "
"Virtually all materials needed for these endeavors can be found here, making "
"this shop a destination for crafters from across the Rift. Security here is "
"handled by the Ironarm clan, and a dozen severed hands nailed above the "
"entrance attest to the family zeal.\n"
"\n"
"On the Guard Captain's quarters and the Fighters Guild we need not dwell, "
"for only the foolish dive into waters so deep and swift-running with no "
"reward in sight.\n"
"\n"
"Ah, but the Mages Guildhall, the most impressive edifice in Riften! My claws "
"quiver in remembrance of the treasures contained therein. Spell components, "
"rare scrolls, and powerful magical items—a trove unique in the Rift. Alas, "
"the safeguards upon them are both subtle and deadly. Venture into this "
"building with all senses alert.\n"
"\n"
"Along the water's edge are the town's docks. While the simple-minded fish "
"from them or gaze into the murky waters, for the acquisitive among us they "
"hold greater delights. Merchants who prefer the shadows can be found along "
"the lower level of the docks, conducting business in the delightfully damp "
"warehouses at the waterline. A purchaser for goods of any sort can usually "
"be found here. The town guard avoids the underdocks or patrols only in "
"large, easily avoided groups.\n"
"\n"
"A grating at one end of the docks leads into a small sewer system. Now used "
"only as a rat pathway, perhaps as Riften grows this will eventually be "
"extended underneath the entire town, rendering it more useful for "
"clandestine operations.\n"
"\n"
"In the hopes that I may contribute to the expansion of our guild's "
"knowledge, I offer this record of my experiences in the town of Riften. Stay "
"moist, comrades. \n"

"\n"
"If one has the opportunity—or misfortune—to deal with the wild clansmen of "
"the Reach, you should know who you're dealing with. There are a number of "
"clans who trade calmly and peaceably with the cities of the North. Then, "
"there are those who view travelers as threats. Or as targets. \n"
"\n"
"In my studies, I've identified three clans in particular that should be "
"avoided at all costs.\n"
"\n"
"Boneshaper Clan:\n"
"\n"
"The Boneshapers have developed an unusual number of rituals involving thorny "
"vines and plants. The clan's name stems from their tradition of lacing or "
"growing these vines through the skeletons of their ritual sacrifices. This "
"plant does not appear to be native to the Reach, but they cultivate it well.\n"
"\n"
"When going on a raid or into battle they use these vines to create effigies, "
"shaping the plants into rough mockeries of life. Some of these rituals also "
"make use of the dead, though necromancy appears to be forbidden in the clan. "
"It's unclear how these bodies are used, but travelers who see their crude "
"clan symbol should stay well clear.\n"
"\n"
"Rageclaw Clan:\n"
"\n"
"The Rageclaws have domesticated a breed of stout, battle-ready ursines. "
"These bears are trained from an early age, bound to a specific clansman or "
"clan family. A matriarchal society, this clan imitates their animal "
"companions in many ways. The protection of young clan members is paramount, "
"and I've seen whole Rageclaw families go into battle over the slightest "
"threat to their children.\n"
"\n"
"A particular habit of the clan causes them friction with other Reach clans: "
"Rageclaws are known to overtake and absorb other smaller clans, converting "
"them to the way of the claw. Women new to the clan find they have tremendous "
"control and freedom, and often enjoy the transition. Male warriors are "
"pitted against grown bears in one-on-one combat, earning a place in the clan "
"by forcing an ursine to submit. It usually goes poorly for clansmen "
"unfamiliar with these massive beasts.\n"
"\n"
"Stonetalon Clan: \n"
"\n"
"Finally the Stonetalon clan, while not as outwardly aggressive as the other "
"two clans above, exhibit a number of particular and combative behaviors. As "
"with the Rageclaws, Stonetalon clans are matriarchies. However, women of the "
"tribe seem to be rare. When they're seen, their women seem to be covered in "
"heavy cloaks made of bird feathers, as if they've all taken ill. I believe "
"they're struggling through a series of trials for an unknown purpose. \n"
"\n"
"In any case, every cloaked female I've encountered has been a powerful "
"spellcaster. Stonetalon clans, as a result, may be the most dangerous groups "
"to meet far afield."
