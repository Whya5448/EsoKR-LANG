"Since the Altmer first looked up at the sky and saw the majestic gryphon "
"soaring on the breeze, there have been dreams to tame the creatures, to ride "
"upon them in times of battle or joy, and feel the freedom of seeing the "
"world far below.\n"
"\n"
"But these were the dreams of children, who quickly learned that the gryphon "
"is proud and fierce, and will not serve as mount to any lesser creature. "
"Generations tried, but the gryphon would never succumb. \n"
"\n"
"The foolish thought to net the creatures in the wild, to break them like a "
"common horse. The gryphon spared future generations from their stupidity. "
"More clever tribes of Altmer managed to scale the cliffs and crags of the "
"isle, taking eggs from the nests of absent parents. Alas, these gambits for "
"years offered no flying mounts, for the eggs would never hatch. Some small "
"comfort was found in the great feasts that followed, for these eggs were "
"held to be delicacies for kings.\n"
"\n"
"One small clan, in the isle's south, would stand up to the untamed splendor "
"of the gryphon and assert itself. Ulorome, whose line would go on to become "
"the Kinlords of Sunhold, found an egg in an abandoned nest during a hunt. "
"Thinking it would never hatch, he brought the egg to his tribe, and prepared "
"it for feast by setting it within the flames of his mighty hearth. Singing "
"the ancient songs of hearth and family, Ulorome sought to bless the meal "
"before his clan would feast—but lo! The warmth of the hearth and the gentle "
"singing brought life to the cold egg, and from it burst a fledgling gryphon. "
"So red did its feathers look in the firelight, that it was thought to be a "
"phoenix by some. Ulorome, crying out in thanks to the gods for such a gift, "
"wrested the creature from the burning embers and christened it Cel-hinwe.\n"
"\n"
"The legends do not say if Cel-hinwe ever carried his master into battle, but "
"it is known that this creature, the Red Wind of Maormer legend, would become "
"the progenitor of Sunhold's famed gryphon line. These two lines are woven "
"around one another, the kinlords and their gryphons, to the point where one "
"cannot be said to exist without the other. The gryphons have in turn been "
"adopted as the heart of Sunhold, its burning symbol of defiance."

"What nightmares! \n"
"\n"
"I cannot close my eyes but see terror in the darkness of dreams. Lurid "
"grotesqueries stalk beyond the ring of my mind's candlelight, striking when "
"I cannot keep among the waking any longer.\n"
"\n"
"I have tried all methods for calming my thoughts. Meditation. Hypnosis. "
"Honeyberry Tea. But the moment I slip into sleep I am once more assailed by "
"the terrors that await me there.\n"
"\n"
"In a moment of desperation, I turn to my quill. In writing what I see in "
"dream, I hope that I may expel the darkness I see at night.\n"
"\n"
"In dream I sit on the gentle shore of Artaeum, where waves from the endless "
"aether lap at sand. The sun sits low and red in the sky, almost mocking me "
"with tranquility.\n"
"\n"
"Then, from the sea erupts a creature—gigantic, corrupted with the parasites "
"and spawn of the ocean's recesses—that makes its way to shore, leaving a "
"foam of crimson in its wake. All the water around it turns black, all the "
"fish die, all the wind and roar is quieted. Its five heads rake and bite one "
"another, crying with their dissonant voices. And despite the perverse "
"knotting and writhing of its heads the creature still plods forward, sowing "
"destruction as it does. One of the heads is little more than rotting flesh "
"and bone, and even as it roars I see the bottom-feeders of the ocean depths "
"feasting on its putrid flesh. With its every roar the dead tremble and "
"dance, puppets on strings before its unholy power.\n"
"\n"
"A second head bore pustules and pox-scars, bulbous blisters of fluid that "
"glowed in crimson and cyan—these would burst, oozing their contents into one "
"another, and these horrible concoctions would hiss and sputter, burn and "
"smoke. The others would lap this fouled fluid with glee and dismay.\n"
"\n"
"A third head was black as a night without stars, as onyx in a windowless "
"room. And darker still were its eyes, pulling the shadows made long by the "
"sun into a shroud of pure darkness.\n"
"\n"
"The fourth head was obscured to me. I could not discern its features.\n"
"\n"
"But the last, the fifth head—so terrible it was to behold, for it was "
"several times the size of the others. By its screeching only would the "
"others tremble and quell their fighting. This massive head was little more "
"than a ring of teeth, seated upon which was a terrible brain—a loathsome "
"mottled thing, its wrinkles and folds undulating in a sinister and "
"nauseating series of pulses. Strands of ichor and bile seeped from its "
"fleshy recesses as barnacles and polyps, affixed to its surface, seemed to "
"gasp for want of air. \n"
"\n"
"Then the creature's heads turned their attentions to me. I was frozen, am "
"frozen, will always be frozen by the eyes raking over me, and worse still is "
"the song they sang in unison, a ruinous cacophony:\n"
"\n"
"Ketor-A, En-Garsa! Bekor-gen, Zema-ja!\n"
"Ulvorkus waits,\n"
"Ulvorkus wakes,\n"
"Ketor-A, En-Garsa! Bekor-gen, Zema-ja!\n"
"\n"
"And at the apex of this terrible verse, as the sun gave way to terrible "
"night, I would see the outline on a distant horizon—a mountain forming from "
"the sea. And falling into the water from this peak were more creatures—too "
"many to count, too horrible to name.\n"
"\n"
"They are coming.\n"
"\n"
"They are coming for us.\n"
"\n"
"And when the sun goes down completely, I wake up screaming."

"\n"
"For millennia we Altmer have safeguarded a divine legacy. We are all that "
"remains of Old Ehlnofey. We were entrusted by the et'Ada to preserve what "
"they sacrificed so much to create. Those who have remained true to our "
"traditions have kept their heritage pure and our civilization unspoiled. "
"Those who have strayed from the path the Aldmer laid out for us, on the "
"other hand, have been debased. They have become degenerates, unrecognizable "
"from the Divines that created them.\n"
"\n"
"Those who would call themselves Mer beyond these sacred Isles are nothing "
"but the twisted remains of the Aldmer. When you look into the ruddy eyes of "
"a Dark Elf, do you see anything of yourself there? Of course not. All you "
"see are the ashes of something greater, utterly destroyed by the False "
"Prophet Veloth and shaped into repugnant shadows by the Daedra he served. "
"When you see the hideous, malformed Orcs, do you see a creation of the "
"Aedra? No! What you see is only the feculence of Boethiah. Leavings so "
"loathsome that they had to sculpt their own dung-god from filth to give "
"their existence any meaning.\n"
"\n"
"But it is not just these pitiable wretches we must learn from, for it is not "
"only those who are foolish enough to be seduced by the Daedra who threaten "
"to warp our way of life. Look upon the Wood Elf and see how even the "
"misguided worship of the Divines can pervert our lineage. There is a "
"difference between appreciating the forest and becoming a beast. Now these "
"wayward cousins are barely more than savage barbarians who devour their own "
"kin. I am grateful none of the First Folk remain to see how corrupted their "
"perfection has become.\n"
"\n"
"The lesson is clear. To stray, even slightly, from the ways of our ancestors "
"will have dire consequences. Knowing that, can you acquiesce to throwing "
"open the gates and welcoming corruption into these holy lands with a smile? "
"The Unforeseen Queen is the harbinger of our destruction. We must resist her "
"heresy!"

"Fairly met, travelers. You now count yourselves among the privileged few "
"mainlanders to set foot in Altmeri lands. Was the crisp air and vibrant "
"color of the Blue Divide everything you'd imagined? If you had the luxury of "
"crossing it upon one of our ships, I have no doubt it was the smoothest "
"sailing of your lives. Consider it merely the first courtesy and comfort of "
"many in your visit to the Isles. Let the warmth of our sun and the scent of "
"sweet blossoms greet you as you leave the cool waters of the cape behind you."
"\n"
"\n"
"Try not to be intimidated by the bustle of Vulkhel Guard. The townsfolk are "

"have the patience for dealing with sailors, as they do, rest assured they "

"pursuits—that has been honed for thousands of years.\n"
"\n"
"You may find yourself overwhelmed by such enriching experiences, but ease "
"your mind. The Isles are a place of harmony and you will find your "
"equilibrium by letting its natural tranquility guide you. The Sapiarchs "
"ensure that each element, from the tallest tree, to the shortest blade of "
"grass, is in perfect balance. \n"
"\n"
"It would be best not to wander too far and disrupt the usual serenity, but "
"if you head north from Vulkhel Guard you'll find the South Beacon "
"Lighthouse, a charming structure that guides our Royal Navy safely through "
"the night. The cliff that it is built upon provides a lovely view of the "

"Shimmerene, busily ferrying goods and citizens to and from Auridon. You may "
"be tempted to ascend the lighthouse for a better view, but please refrain "
"from disturbing the attendants.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"Seven-fold venerations to you, my dearest kin. Set aside your noble pursuits "
"a moment and let your mind wander with me.\n"
"\n"
"We'll begin this wondrous journey from the seat of civilization that is "
"Alinor. Nestled among the mountains of the western shore, the city climbs "
"nearly as high as the peaks themselves, its white spires reaching far into "
"the sky. From these heights our sovereigns have surveyed their dominion for "
"thousands of years. Avail yourself of the opportunity to see the splendor of "
"the Royal Palace and offer your respects to the crown. The sense of pride "
"you will feel at basking in the unrivaled greatness of our kingdom is well "
"worth the journey. \n"
"\n"
"If you have a taste for the exotic, there is no better place on Summerset "
"than Alinor to sample cosmopolitan fare. Sundries from all over Tamriel are "
"ferried into port daily. Those the Divine Prosecution finds fit for sale "
"will give you a whole new perspective on life, and a greater appreciation "
"for Altmer craft.\n"
"\n"
"To see why our goods are such a cut above we only need to take a quick ferry "
"ride across the bay to Lillandril. This venerable town has been the center "
"of higher learning for centuries. Many a king and queen have come seeking "
"the wisdom of the College of Sapiarchs, where the two-hundred and twenty-"
"three greatest minds of our people advance our knowledge of all things.\n"
"\n"
"For the arts, we follow the highway east to Rellenthil to see where the "
"finest entertainment in all the world is conceived: The House of Reveries. "
"The Maestros of this famed troupe organize performances day and night in a "
"beautiful outdoor theater from the earliest days of settlement. As heirs to "
"our long legacy of cultural arts, membership is exclusive. Only true talents "
"may join. Whatever your tastes, the House of Reveries is certain to put on a "
"show that will leave you in awe. \n"
"\n"
"Speaking of tastes, allow me to lead you to the birthplace of wine in our "
"Isles, only a short trip down the road. The vineyards of Russafeld span "
"nearly the entire stretch of land between Rellenthil and Shimmerene. Resist "
"the temptation to pluck a ripe grape from the vine. Surely there are no "
"better found in nature, but once you have tasted the fruits of the winery "
"you'll regret having deprived them a single purple pearl. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"But I've had a Russafeld red,\"\" you say! Dearest kin, you haven't "
"truly tasted until you've savored a three-thousand-year-old vintage straight "
"from the cask it aged in. The privilege may cost you the deed to your home, "
"but it is well worth the experience.\n"
"\n"
"Cast your eyes to the north and you'll see Cloudrest perched atop the great "
"mountain Eton Nir. The view from its bridges and terraces will take your "
"breath away, though perhaps not quite so literally as the ascent to reach "
"them. Unless, of course, you count yourself among the Welkynars. The Gryphon "
"Knights keep vigil over our lands from the summit, prepared to take to the "
"skies and soar to the defense of anywhere in Summerset at a moment's notice.\n"
"\n"
"Before departing Cloudrest, take a moment to view the Crystal Tower in all "
"its glory from the best vantage in the Isles. This pillar of enlightenment "
"is the keystone of creation, as old as our oldest ancestors, and an endless "
"font of knowledge. The Sapiarchs protect and study its secrets night and "
"day, hoping to bring us ever closer to the perfection of the Ascendants.\n"
"\n"
"If you need a rest from your travels, Shimmerene is a pleasant sea-side "
"town, filled with pleasant people. It's an ideal place for a quiet night's "
"respite before embarking on a voyage to Auridon, or the long road west. Pay "
"a visit to the Monastery of Serene Harmony while you are there and ask to "
"participate in the rituals of equilibrium. You will never have a better "
"night's sleep.\n"
"\n"
"Take pleasure in greeting the sun as it rises upon the eastern shore to join "
"us on the final leg of our journey. Just south, the pristine wilderness of "
"Sil-Var-Woad is carefully tended to by the rangers of the Royal Menagerie. "
"There you will find a collection of unique creatures from around the world. "
"The grounds are open to the public and free to citizens, making it the "
"perfect destination for a family outing.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, we return westward to Sunhold, the sister city to Alinor. In fact, "
"if not for the mountains between them, the two would inevitably merge into a "
"metropolis not seen since Lost Aldmeris. Possessing one of the largest "
"harbors in Summerset, Sunhold is a frequent target for Sea Elf attack, but "
"the port is nothing if not defensible. From its thick sea walls, to its "
"narrow winding alleys, every stone has been laid out with rebuffing the "
"Maormers' assaults in mind. While it is certainly a formidable fortress, "
"let's not forget it is also a thriving city, and the heart of shipping among "
"the Isles. I highly recommend spending a few hours getting lost in the "
"labyrinthine streets and sampling the best seafood offered anywhere in the "
"world.\n"
"\n"
"Dearest kin, we've come to this journey's end, but I hope this will only be "
"the beginning of your wanderings through our homeland. Though we may pine "
"for Old Ehlnofey, the golden warmth of the Divines will always dry our tears "
"in the sun-kissed land of Summerset."

"Whether you are a recruit for the Royal Navy, or merely taking a voyage into "
"open waters, you will want to know something of the Maormer before you have "
"the misfortune of spotting their ships on the horizon. This guide will help "
"prepare you for the day that you inevitably do. Take heed of that as my "
"first lesson: if you spend any amount of time on sea or shore, you will "
"cross paths with Sea Elves.\n"
"\n"
"As their name suggests, the Sea Elves are at home on the water. They are so "
"able at plying the waves that a Maormer ship can remain at sea indefinitely, "
"so long as it is sea-worthy. The Maormer take full advantage of that fact "
"when raiding our trade vessels, or ambushing our fleets. Never pursue a "
"retreating Sea Elf vessel, even if you think they are hobbled. They will "
"bait you into thinking you can catch them, but make no mistake: Sea Elf "
"cutters are faster than any ship in our fleet. Soon you will find yourself "
"lured out into the open ocean, unable to safely retreat, while they circle "
"you like sharks. Your food stores will dwindle, and once you are finally too "
"weak to put up a fight, the Maormer will swoop in to slaughter you. It is a "
"cowardly, but effective tactic. \n"
"\n"
"Secondly, never flee a Sea Elf vessel unless you can see land. Even then, do "
"so with great care. It is not a matter of if the Maormer will overtake you, "
"it is when. The best course of action when confronted by Maormer ships is to "
"stand and fight. At least then you have some hope of coming out ahead. Sea "
"Elf fleets are most often composed of small, agile vessels well-suited to "
"quick hit-and-run engagements. Bloody their noses quickly and you may drive "
"them off before they are committed to their attack.\n"
"\n"
"When fighting the Maormer, their ballistae are the least of your troubles. "
"They can turn the seas themselves against you. Any ship larger than a sloop "
"is sure to have at least one of their Sea Mages beneath its sails, conjuring "
"wind and storm to toss you about like a toy boat. Every effort should be "
"made to neutralize Maormer Sea Mages as quickly as possible. If the waves "
"have not yet done you in, the Sea Elves will sic their beasts on you. "
"Maormer breed and train a variety of marine predators to bolster their ranks."
" From winged reef vipers that can leap high out of the water and onto your "
"deck, to sea serpents large enough to capsize a warship. In either case, "
"keep moving at a steady clip and the creatures will have difficulty reaching "
"you before they tire.\n"
"\n"
"As for the Maormer themselves, do not let their deceptive tactics fool you. "
"Sea Elves are vicious combatants who want nothing more than to spill Altmer "
"blood. If they manage to board your vessel, you will have a hard fight on "
"your hands. Maormer are exceptionally steady on their feet in even the "
"roughest waters, and nimbler than an acrobat at traversing a ship's rigging. "
"As you might imagine, well-trained and armored marines are the best defense "
"against boarding, but if you find yourself in the melee you will need to "
"assume a formation that will protect your flanks. Sea Elf raiders prefer "
"enveloping tactics that quickly overwhelm a scattered enemy.\n"
"\n"
"There is only so much to be learned from a guide alone, but I hope that this "
"knowledge has better prepared you for the day when your life depends on it. "
"Phynaster guide your sails."

"By Vrithilin, Sapiarch of Current Chronologies\n"
"\n"
"As the Sapiarch charged with understanding and analyzing current events as "
"they relate to the progress and well-being of Summerset, I am often called "
"upon to provide expert opinion of the great questions of the present age. "
"Which brings us to the subject of this treatise. Proxy Queen Alwinarwe has "
"requested the College of Sapiarchs to provide the Royal Palace with "
"everything we know about the Psijic Order. Apparently, the ancient order of "
"arcane sages has returned to offer assistance during the current crisis.\n"
"\n"
"We know with absolute certainty that the Psijic Order once served as "
"advisors and teachers to the greatest rulers of Tamriel. We also know that "
"approximately three-hundred-and-fifty years ago, the sages retreated to "
"their island of Artaeum to study in seclusion. Then the island, quite "
"literally, disappeared.\n"
"\n"
"What is the Psijic Order? This ancient organization originated on Summerset "
"and formed the basis for arcane magic as we know it today. At some point in "
"history, they occupied the island of Artaeum and made Ceporah Tower their "
"headquarters. So much can be attributed to the Psijic Order, including the "
"creation of the Mages Guild (by former Psijic sage Vanus Galerion) and the "
"development of Mysticism. It has been claimed that Mysticism, or the Old "
"Way, can unravel the mysteries of the universe when properly applied to the "
"problem. It can also be used to peer into the future and may have been the "
"basis of the advice they provided to Tamriel's leaders.\n"
"\n"
"When our ancestors settled Summerset, our culture began to change. We no "
"longer worshiped the ancestor spirits, instead elevating a few of those "
"spirits to godhood and revering them. A group of elders at this time "
"rebelled against this trend. They called themselves Psijics, the keepers of "
"the Old Ways. They retreated to Artaeum to remove themselves from the "
"corruption of Altmer society. This dislike of the new ways didn't stop them "
"from returning to offer advice and guidance, however.\n"
"\n"
"My recommendation? Accept the help offered by the Psijic Order. We could do "
"worse than to have these masters of Mysticism at our side in these times of "
"trouble."

"By Adandora, Chronicler at Large\n"
"\n"
"The College of Sapiarchs. It lies to the west of Lillandril, on a small "
"island outcropping that rises from the sea. The general public cannot access "
"the compound, not without obtaining the permission of the portal master who "
"controls the magical egress that leads from Lillandril proper to the small "
"island. They say this is to protect the sages and maintain the solitude they "
"need to think deep thoughts and study obscure lore. This chronicler has made "
"repeated attempts to ascertain what exactly goes on in the isolated college "
"compound. Here is what I have uncovered.\n"
"\n"
"First, though, some background on the Sapiarchs themselves. There are two-"
"hundred-and-twenty-three fully accredited Sapiarchs at any given time, each "
"devoted to and responsible for a specific field of study. The current leader "
"of the Sapiarchs, Larnatille of Lillandril, for example, serves as the "
"Sapiarch of Arcanology, encapsulating the collected knowledge of arcane lore "
"within her prodigious mind. The Sapiarchs, in turn, are each assisted by one "
"or more acolytes. These Sapiarchs-in-training hope to one day replace their "
"masters and earn a seat in the college, though that isn't the only path for "
"aspiring sages to take. Any distinguished High Elf scholar could receive a "
"summons at any time and be invited to join the prestigious college.\n"
"\n"
"Individually, Sapiarchs conduct and catalog research to expand their "
"particular area of expertise, give lectures, consult when called upon in "
"regards to their field of study, and write papers and books to expound upon "
"their subject matter. As a group, the function of the College of Sapiarchs "
"is to advise the current rulers of Summerset and train the heirs to the "
"throne. They also issue proclamations as necessary when research and study "
"reveal new information the public needs to know and they review such "
"research to determine if it should be included in scholarly reference "
"material.\n"
"\n"
"Now let's get back to the physical compound that also goes by the name of "
"the College of Sapiarchs. Now, while this chronicler has not yet been able "
"to personally explore the College compound, I have it on good authority that "
"the following details are mostly true and predominantly reliable. The walled "
"compound fills the small island that lies directly west of Lillandril. The "
"main level of the compound features, from what I've been able to gather, a "
"grand library, study halls, and suites for the most senior members of the "
"College. I understand that dormitories and study cells are available for the "
"use of the lesser Sapiarchs.\n"
"\n"
"The true wonder of the College of Sapiarchs, though, not counting their "
"connection to the Crystal Tower, is the massive maze of chambers and "
"corridors beneath the main compound. This area, known as the Labyrinth, "
"serves a number of functions, but its most celebrated use revolves around "
"the matriculation of the royal heirs of Alinor. When an heir to the throne "
"reaches the appropriate age, they go to the Sapiarchs' Labyrinth to study "
"Altmeri Regal Praxis and Ceremoniarchy for 3,555 days before being crowned. \n"
"\n"
"This chronicler is quite certain that the mysterious College of Sapiarchs "
"contains additional secrets, but as long as the sages demand privacy and the "
"Queen and her agents support such a policy, the people of Summerset will "
"never know what truly lurks within the walls of the College compound."

"By High Magistrate Rinwaray, Bureaureeve of the Divine Prosecution\n"
"\n"
"The Divine Prosecution stands as the highest authority of law and order on "
"Summerset Isle, second only to the Queen and her Royal Court. And while we "
"acquiesce to the will of the Kinlords and Kinladies, we have both the duty "
"and power to investigate possible malfeasance even among the nobles should "
"the need arise.\n"
"\n"
"Take, for example, the Case of the Disloyal Canonreeve. This was a number of "
"years ago, before Queen Ayrenn took the throne. The Canonreeve of Cloudrest "
"at the time was a well-respected Altmer of noble birth from a family with an "
"unparalleled lineage. Which, of course, just goes to demonstrate that blood "
"alone doesn't make the Altmer. Rumors began to reach one of our judiciars, "
"and she began to look into the Canonreeve and his business practices. After "
"a thorough investigation, it was determined that the Canonreeve was keeping "
"choice antiquities from a nearby historical research project taking place in "
"one of the many ruins within the Eton Nir mountain. He altered manifests and "
"records so that he could sell the antiquities to foreign collectors, leaving "
"no trace that any items had gone missing. The judiciar gathered the evidence "
"and eventually the Canonreeve learned that not even rank and noble blood "
"were above the law of the land.\n"
"\n"
"The Divine Prosecution also deals in matters of religious and cultural law. "
"It is our job to police the social ordinances of Altmer society. The Case of "
"the Imperfect Perfection provides an example for us to review. This incident "
"concerned a jewelry crafter who had a run of bad luck that resulted in "
"multiple necklaces, rings, and amulets that had noticeable flaws in their "
"construction. It fell to Chief Justiciar Naldulmo to investigate the "
"accusations of consistent failure to craft perfect jewelry on the part of "
"the artisan. When the Chief Justiciar ascertained that the crafter was "
"indeed guilty of falling far from her past level of perfection, he carried "
"out the warranted punishment and ordered the crafter to smash her alaxon "
"sphere while he watched. The crafter would have to work to regain a state of "
"perfection and petition to receive a new sphere.\n"
"\n"
"These are just some of the cases handled by the Divine Prosecution."

"By Larnatille of Lillandril, Sapiarch of Arcanology\n"
"\n"
"The Crystal Tower rises over northern Summerset, standing as a beacon and a "
"symbol of everything the Altmer hold dear. Also known as the Crystal-Like-"
"Law, the tower, contrary to the beliefs of those who live beyond our "
"cherished borders, is not made of crystal. No, the tower is named for the "
"crystal that resides at the utmost level, Transparent Law.\n"
"\n"
"Transparent Law lends power and energy to the Crystal Tower, which allows "
"the mystical structure to offer its protections to all of Summerset. The "
"energy radiates from the tower, spreading across the land like an invisible "
"awning to keep the island safe and secure.\n"
"\n"
"Now, these protections are ancient and were set in place long ago when the "
"crystal was imbedded within the tower by the Aldmer who erected it. In "
"truth, for all our knowledge, the Sapiarchs do not fully understand the "
"exact workings of the tower or the crystal. We know that the Aldmer "
"constructed the Crystal Tower to preserve the graves of the early Aldmeri "
"settlers and forever remember the spirit of the Elven people and mark that "
"brief moment in history when we were fully unified.\n"
"\n"
"As for the significance of Transparent Law, I should think that to be self "
"evident. One only has to break down the meaning of the name and all becomes "
"clear. To be transparent is to be easily recognized or detected, to be made "
"manifest, to be open, obvious, and candid. Law, meanwhile, refers to the "
"principles and regulations that govern some specific portion of reality. In "
"this case, the crystal manifests the clear and unequivocal fundamental "
"principles of our Aldmer heritage. Indeed, we suspect that the crystal may "
"even be a fragment of divinity given physical substance.\n"
"\n"
"Obviously, theories concerning the Transparent Law and its significance to "
"the Crystal Tower abound within the College of Sapiarchs. I like to believe "
"that the crystal absorbs the drive for perfection that marks the Altmer and "
"reflects it back, driving away any imperfections that would weaken or "
"endanger the island. Not everyone agrees with me, but I see a correlation "
"between the pride and admiration our people feel for the Crystal Tower and "
"the feeling of security and safety that it, in turn, projects across the "
"land. It is a symbiotic relationship.\n"
"\n"
"Or, it could just be ancient Aldmer magic. Who can really say?"

"By Raavarion, Sapiarch of Aquatic Malevolence \n"
"\n"
"The sea that surrounds our beloved island provides sustenance and resources, "
"allows for swift transportation, and serves as a boundary between Summerset "
"and the rest of the world. Unfortunately, however, not everything that comes "
"from the sea can be considered beneficial, and there exists many seaborne "
"threats that pose a significant danger to the island. We here in the College "
"of Sapiarchs have deemed the level of danger high enough that we have "
"devoted an entire field of study to help research and formulate "
"countermeasures, hence my appointment to the post of Sapiarch of Aquatic "
"Malevolence.\n"
"\n"
"Threats from the sea appear in many different forms, from natural events to "
"enemy kingdoms. Nature has a way of letting the island know that even the "
"magical protections provided by the Crystal Tower aren't always enough to "
"stop a destructive storm, crashing waves, or flood waters from damaging "
"Summerset. As far as enemies are concerned, the Royal Navy keeps the sea "
"lanes as clear as possible and serves as a deterrent to the forces of the "
"other alliances. The exception to this remains the various factions of the "
"Maormer—the Sea Elves—who fearlessly slip past patrols to raid coastal "
"settlements on a regular basis.\n"
"\n"
"Probably the most fearsome potential threat appears in the form of the Sload."
" Even though these vile creatures from the southwestern Abecean Sea were "
"much more ambitious in their attempts to conquer Summerset in centuries "
"past, the residents of the coral kingdoms of Thras continue to pillage and "
"raid our holdings to the current day. The amphibious, slug-like beings have "
"an affinity for magic, though they seem more drawn to dark magic than to "
"anything positive or beneficial. They deal in necromancy, plagues, and other "
"instruments of death and destruction.\n"
"\n"
"Recent rumors heard across the island suggest that a particular type of "
"Sload, the Sea Sload, have returned to trouble Summerset. While they haven't "
"been seen or heard from in centuries, the Sea Sloads rule the undersea "
"kingdom of Ul'vor Kus, located somewhere in the Sea of Pearls. Even the "
"possibility that such creatures have infiltrated the island is cause for "
"concern and utmost diligence. To this end, I have consulted old tomes and "
"ancient volumes contained within our extensive libraries to gather whatever "
"information I can. I'm sorry to say, it isn't much. The Sea Sloads are even "
"more reclusive and mysterious than their more numerous cousins.\n"
"\n"
"What I could uncover indicates that we should not underestimate the threat "
"the Sea Sloads pose. Instead of organizing themselves in small kingdoms, as "
"the Thras Sload are wont to do, the Sea Sloads form cabals of small numbers "
"of like-minded individuals who cooperate to attain some specific goal. Then "
"the cabals break up, reform, and reorganize as interests and necessity "
"warrant. While Sea Sloads have as much interest in necromancy as any other "
"Sloads, they also demonstrate skill in alchemy, shadow magic, and mind "
"magic, among other arcane disciplines. For all their ambition and power, "
"however, our records indicate that the Sea Sloads may in fact be on the "
"verge of extinction. My predecessor, Winawen, certainly wrote as much in her "
"seminal work, \"\"The Villains of Ul'Vor Kus.\"\" It was her educated "
"opinion that the Sea Sloads would naturally disappear within a few centuries."
" Such an event cannot occur soon enough.\n"
"\n"
"Until confirmation of Sea Sload activity on Summerset is verified, I suggest "
"we remain vigilant and watch the sea. Besides the Sea Sloads themselves, "
"these arrogant and unfriendly creatures have been known to utilize all kinds "
"of terrible sea monsters. The last thing the island needs in these turbulent "
"times is attacks by creatures from the sea."

"\n"
"Sailors are known for their stories. Tall tales of faraway places, great "
"beasts, vast treasures, beautiful temptresses, and storms that could end the "
"world. Many take these claims with a healthy dose of skepticism, but not all "
"the legends you hear are pure fantasy. Away from the relative calm of the "
"Iliac Bay the sea can harbor some truly frightening things. Among them are "
"the Maormer leviathans.\n"
"\n"
"If you've never seen a Sea Elf, they're strange, but unremarkable. Similar "
"to High Elves in build, their skin is the color of ocean spray and their "
"eyes pale. Most wouldn't give them a second glance if not for their "
"elaborate tattoos and their vicious demeanor. The ones their kind call "
"leviathans, however, they'll make your blood run as cold as their own.\n"
"\n"
"The spawn of some unholy and sorcerous coupling of Sea Elf and Sea Serpent, "
"these giants stand a head and a half over the most towering of Nords when "
"they draw themselves to their full height. A rare sight since these Elves "
"mostly carry themselves in a beastly posture, bent and arced like a snake "
"ready to strike. When they do make their move, they don't so much stride as "
"slither along in an uneven, predatory lope—like they're unused to both land "
"and legs.\n"
"\n"
"The first time I laid eyes on one in the flesh, she was clambering up the "
"hull of my ship like a centipede—weaving back and forth as she effortlessly "
"glided up the slippery boards. The way the light glittered off her blue "
"scales was almost beautiful, but her dead, white eyes were as impassive as a "
"shark's and her grin as mirthless.\n"
"\n"
"I doubled over in fright as she shot over the starboard railing. She was on "
"me in an instant, pinning me to the deck with her great size, ready to "
"strike me down with a killing blow, or so I thought. Instead, she regarded "
"me with a chilling dispassion and I froze like a mouse that's locked eyes "
"with a snake. I was both captivated and terrified. It was the popping of her "
"jaw stretching out of place to swallow me that finally snapped me out of my "
"shock and gave me the sense to struggle.\n"
"\n"
"I was no match for the leviathan's strength, but I managed to wrest a hand "
"free and drive it into the back of her throat. The gout of flame she choked "
"on put an end to her perverse existence, but the mark she left on me I'll "
"carry until the end of my days. If you should ever see the scaled Elves "
"lurking below the waves, my prayers go with you."

"I very politely asked him what was in his most recent delivery. He did not "

"persisted—gently, mind you! When I asked him a second time, he fixed those "
"icy eyes on me and whispered something in the forgotten tongue of the "
"Ublivey mystics. At the time, I thought he said \"\"If you ask again, you "
"will know regret.\"\" But after some uncomfortable reflection, I think he "

"\n"
"The Welkynar are part of an order which spans nearly all of Summerset's "
"grand history. We dedicate our lives to protecting our homeland, to fight "
"back against the dark tides of evil. Wherever malice rears its ugly head, "
"wherever villains threaten our citizens, that is where we shall be.\n"
"\n"
"Though Cloudrest may be where we lay our heads, our order answers any urgent "
"call. This need for quick mobility is what led the first of our order to "
"bond with gryphons. With the aid of these creatures, our order is able to "
"quickly move to far away locations. This is what led the Welkynars to choose "
"Cloudrest as the home of our Aerie, given the city's central location within "
"the island.\n"
"\n"
"Our order numbers four, representative of each of the cardinal directions. "
"When one member decides to retire or dies in the line of duty, another is "
"chosen to replace them. This initiate's training will take years to "
"complete, as they will need to first capture and raise their own gryphon "
"companion. \n"
"\n"
"Each Welkynar is chosen for his or her combat abilities. Though our order is "
"well known for producing some of the finest battlemages within Summerset, "
"magical ability is not necessarily a requirement to join. After all, "
"Mornyalemar the Battle-Hardy is thought to be one of the greatest Welkynars "
"to ever live, and had not one ounce of magical ability. An initiate need "
"only prove themselves highly capable in battle to join our ranks.\n"
"\n"
"Any member of either Summerset governance or military may petition the "
"Wekynars for aid. Of course, accepting the petition has always been up to "
"the order's discretion. Between assignments, our members continue to patrol "
"Summerset for signs of danger, often stopping in cities and collecting "
"information on any potential threats.\n"
"\n"
"Yes, a Welkynar never truly rests. But for this lifelong dedication, we "
"ensure the safety of every citizen of Summerset. There is truly no greater "
"honor than joining the ranks of this prestigious order."

"Now, let's get this straight. Gryphon training is no joking matter. Within "
"the wild, these beasts are deadly. Dangerous. They'd eat you sooner than "
"look at you. There's many trainers in Sunhold who can attest to that. Even "
"the chicks are known to peck off a finger or two, if you're not careful.\n"
"\n"
"As a Welkynar, you'll be expected to raise your gryphon from the time it "
"hatches to the day it dies. Or you die, of course, given our line of work. "
"This starts off by collecting an egg. Yes, you collect the egg, so don't "
"expect to be handed one your first day. And I suggest you don't go killing "
"the gryphon mother, either. It's hard to be bonded to a creature you've "
"brutally orphaned. Trust me on that.\n"
"\n"
"Once your chick has hatched, the bonding process can begin. You'll "
"immediately begin to undergo magical rituals to create a bond. But other "
"than that, your relationship must grow from familiarity. You'll feed, clean, "
"and care for this chick. Expect a lot of pecks, scratches, and sleepless "
"nights.\n"
"\n"
"Once the bonding process has been complete, your gryphon will be trained to "
"fight by your side. This gryphon will be your steed, protector, and "
"steadfast friend. Their training will be just as stringent and hard as yours."
" And, by the end of it, the creature will become a soldier finer than most.\n"
"\n"
"Now remember, this isn't a commitment to be taken lightly. The bond you form "
"with your gryphon will be unlike anything you've experienced.  Rather than a "
"mere companion, your gryphon shall become an extension of your very self. "
"Your thoughts, your feelings, your needs, everything will be connected.\n"
"\n"
"Should you successfully accomplish this responsibility, you'll be welcomed "
"within the ranks of the Welkynars. An honor that will change your entire "
"course of life. So choose your egg wisely, candidate."

"Definite evidence of Sea Sload incursion on Summerset. We're tracking one of "

"\n"
"* * *\n"

"* * *\n"

"Sapiarchs have named \"\"abyssal pearls.\"\" It radiated a foul magic that "

"sorts for the yaghra. Upon destroying the pearl, the terrible event came to "
"an abrupt end.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"We tracked the Sea Sload to its hiding spot in Welenkin Cove. The creature "
"called itself B'Korgen as it addressed its yaghra servants with a "
"combination of its guttural verbal language and by speaking directly into "
"their minds. If we got close enough, the mind magic seeped into our own "
"heads. It was a strange and defiling experience.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"B'Korgen appeared to be tending to a bed of growing abyssal pearls. It drew "
"strange sigils in the water around the pearls and even upon their lustrous "
"surfaces, and added alchemical mixtures to the water that made the sea glow "
"with an arcane light. I'm sure this is the source of each pearl's magic.\n"

"* * *\n"
"A cloaked and hooded High Elf paid a clandestine visit to the Sea Sload in "
"Welenkin Cove while we made our observations. The figure spoke softly, but a "

"* * *\n"
"I took a chance and slipped closer to try to get a better look at the "

"definitely combining magic and alchemy to alter the nature of the abyssal "
"pearls. I wish I had more time to study the creature's techniques. I heard "

"\n"
"By this point, you must have read the inane ramblings of the now disgraced "
"sage, Nonus Caprenius. It brings me no joy to cast aspersions on his name. "
"Caprenius was once an eminent scholar whose mastery of beastly sciences far "
"surpassed that of his peers. Alas, his obsession with the bull-men and their "
"dubious origins proved too much for the community to bear. Allow me to "
"clarify this matter and put it to rest once and for all.\n"

"Caprenius, clearly in the throes of some mania, suggests that minotaurs are "
"the descendants of Alessia and her legendary consort Morihaus, the bull-man. "
"Beyond being lightly heretical, this assertion finds no basis in historical "
"fact. The fate of Alessia's son, Belharza the Man-Bull, is well "
"known—catalogued (obliquely) by countless scholars of the period. He met his "
"fate at the biting-tips of Elven spears. That much is certain. Connecting "
"the Slave-Queen to a brutish race of bull-headed savages merely because they "
"share a physical feature makes no more sense that connecting men to guars "
"since we both walk on two legs.\n"
"\n"
"The fact is that minotaurs are the bitter fruit of some spell or alchemical "
"process gone awry. There is no great conspiracy—no zealously guarded "
"secret—just an unfortunate, ghastly accident. Truly, who could look at one "

"blood? These are the ravings of a disturbed mind, and should be treated as "

"During The Reman Dynasty's wars of expansion, the Imperial Legion mounted "
"countless sieges on fortresses both great and small. In most cases, "
"merciless bombardment prompted a swift surrender. The Imperials' mastery of "
"digging and siege works combined with the Akaviri's fire wizardry and "
"alchemical prowess seemed unstoppable. Even so, some foes fancied themselves "
"the Empire's equals. The false-god of the Dark Elves, Vivec the Liar, was "
"such a foe.\n"
"\n"
"Over the course of several months, Reman II's legions drove the Dark Elves "
"back deep into their own territory. At length, the Elves dug in at the "
"venerable fortress of Ald Marak. It was an imposing fortress to be sure, "
"with high, sturdy walls, and deep-water approaches that made assaults on "
"foot nearly impossible.\n"
"The sons and daughters of the Tribunal faith consolidated their forces "
"behind those walls, content to wait for their god's arrival. But Vivec did "
"not arrive. On the advice of a foolish spy, he took a defensive position "
"elsewhere, in the shadow of Ald Iuval. Too far away to intervene when the "
"dark hour came.\n"
"\n"
"The Imperials knew well the power of faith and fanaticism. Engaging the "
"armies of Morrowind with their god at their back was a fool's gambit. Rather "
"than settle in for a protracted siege, the Imperials concocted a bold plan. "
"Under cover of nightfall, their mystics weaved great spells of water-"
"breathing. Thus ensorcelled, the heavily armored legion marched into Lake "
"Coronati. At length, they emerged from the water like vengeful ghosts, "
"thundered through the lightly guarded gates, and burned the fort like a "

"I was a fool to ever come to this forest. I thought myself clever, powerful, "

"the rest of the world.\n"

"This entrapment set in motion the moment I stepped within this forest. Why "
"didn't I question it? That voice, leading me, guiding me. Straight to where "
"she needed me. And how long was I ignorant to it? How long did I study this "
"language, used it, tried to bend it to my will? Too long.\n"

"She needs this language for something. She understands it, but cannot use it."
" She needs me, just as I need her. Her whispers tell me only that which she "
"wishes me to hear. And I listened, and I obeyed. Unknowingly loyal, "
"unknowingly obliging. But no longer.\n"

"I've figured it out. No more leaning on whispers, no more working through "
"her will alone. The Southern stone. Baneweh telde. That's the way I'll "
"return to my original time. And then I can stop all of this from happening. "
"I can stop myself from stepping into that doorway, and into this prison.\n"

"I suspect she knows though. Despite my relative ease moving through this "
"forest so far, so long as I do stay within it, all of my attempts to travel "
"to the Southern stone have been thwarted. This silent battle between me and "

"By Felinwoin, Summerset's Leading Chronicler\n"
"\n"
"Since the fall of our reverent ancestors, we know that not all mer are "
"created equal. We High Elves chose to walk within the glorious footsteps of "
"those who went before us. We are the golden, the powerful, the just. Others, "
"like the Dark Elves, betrayed our ways and were cursed for their impunity. "
"They pray to their false gods and muck about in the ash.\n"
"\n"
"And then there are our current allies, the Wood Elves. Well, what is there "
"to say about the Wood Elves? It is true that they follow our gods, however "
"lightly, given their clear preference for Y'ffre. That, and their pointed "
"ears, are where my comparisons must stop. Everything else about them, from "
"their culture to their stature, is far removed from our level of perfection.\n"
"\n"
"Still, do we have anything to fear from our primitive cousins? I made it my "
"mission to find out.\n"
"\n"
"The stars were keen for me to complete this particular assignment, for it "
"was just as I set my mind to investigate that I was invited to an exclusive "
"engagement. The details, of course, shall remain anonymous (though I can say "
"it was within the abode of a rather high-ranking member of our royalty), but "
"it gave me the opportunity I had been seeking. Among those on the invitation "
"list, which I of course perused before sending my acceptance, were several "
"Wood Elves.\n"
"\n"
"Here I could see our allies attempt to socialize with some of the most "
"prestigious members of Summerset society. What an opportunity to witness how "
"well they fit into our culture. With notebook in hand and wearing one of my "
"many gorgeous dresses, I eagerly traveled to the abode of my host.\n"
"\n"
"I could barely contain my excitement as I made my way to the dining table. "
"There, clustered together in a little clan of their own, were the Wood Elves "
"who would be the focus of my investigation. I was quickly told by a fellow "
"acquaintance that they were followers of the Green Pact, a lucky coincidence "
"if ever I saw one. It was exactly this barbaric belief that many feared "
"would clash so fiercely against Summerset's pristine principles. \n"
"\n"
"The first strangeness occurred when the meals were served to them. As we "
"know, the Green Pact does not allow for the use or consumption of plant "
"material. As such, our most gracious host saw fit to serve these Wood Elves "
"nothing but the finest cuts of Summerset meat. They ate their meal with what "
"can only be described as ravenous gusto, with not one care for the proper "
"use of their silverware. Why, one even scooped up the juices upon her plate "
"with a dessert spoon!\n"
"\n"
"As I watched this small tribe devour its meal, I could only imagine a legion "
"of Wood Elves arriving to consume our local fauna. With that being their "
"only sustenance, can we truly trust our little cousins to restrain "
"themselves? There may come a day when no cow, chicken, pig, or even cat will "
"grace our tranquil island. Can we truly allow for such a future?\n"
"\n"
"Still, I was determined to engage with these guests. After dinner I made my "
"way to one, my decorum as impeccable as always, and asked what brought him "
"to our island.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I'm 'ere on be'alf of the king,\"\" he told me, his rather thick accent "
"marring each syllable. \"\"Gotta' show you 'igh Elfs that we're civilized "
"like.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Each word he muttered, of course, led me farther from that conclusion. "
"Still, I politely inquired what he believed Wood Elves would bring to the "
"glory of Summerset. What contribution could his people make for the "
"betterment of all the High Elves who called our isle home?\n"
"\n"
"I'm afraid he got rather coarse after that simple question. His wording was "
"such that one might assume ignorance, but the vulgarity of his word choice "
"showed outright hostility. I'm afraid to say he dared to call into question "
"my pure intentions by asking such a question, adding more than a few choice "
"descriptions about my person!\n"
"\n"
"I was simply flabbergasted. Quickly, one of his companions apologized to me "
"and whisked him away. Still, the damage was done. I had seen quite enough of "
"the manners and propriety of those we had chosen to welcome into our borders."
"\n"
"\n"
"I also remind you, my dear readers, the cultural differences that may prove "
"quite perilous to our way of life. Cannibalism, blatant thievery, trees that "
"walk about! How can we trust the Wood Elves to live properly alongside us, "
"rather than running around in their little bone huts? From all that I've "
"witnessed, I cannot believe such a thing is possible. \n"
"\n"
"I urge you, dear readers, to protest. Raise your voices against the moderate "
"tide! Allow not a step more to be taken. Instead, push back. We must return "
"Summerset to the glory of the past, and once again make it a home for High "
"Elves and High Elves only.\n"
"\n"
"Will you join me in that cause?"

"\n"
"I have heard your cries, your pleas, your demands for the truth. And, just "
"as always, Feliwoin is here to deliver. Bringing you nothing but the latest "
"and most relevant news, I knew exactly what role I must play in this new "
"proclamation. I am of course talking about the new laws that allow our "
"Dominion allies access to the shores of Summerset. Many are concerned about "
"the impacts of such an event, with good reason. Are our streets safe? Are "
"our homes secure?\n"
"\n"
"Readers, I made it my mission to find out.\n"
"\n"
"I started with Alinor, home to our royal court and most regal Proxy Queen "
"Alwinarwe, may long she live and reign gloriously in these most troubling of "
"times. Walking the streets, I made sure to disguise myself in garb as common "
"as I could possibly find. Not a soul knew who I was, and that was just the "
"way I wanted it. Crawling through the common rabble would allow me access to "
"our new so-called-allies.\n"
"\n"
"My first encounter involved a rather brusque Khajiit making a purchase at "
"the grocery. I observed from the sides, ever vigilant toward any case of "
"sticky paws, given their propensity toward thievery. I was unable to observe "
"any theft, but was there to bear witness a rather astonishing exchange. This "
"Khajiit went up to the store clerk, put his items on the counter, and simply "
"asked, \"\"How much?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"No, you did not read that wrong dear readers! No greeting, not so much as an "
"honor or a praise! Apparently, our allies are too good for even basic, "
"common manners. Oh, Auri-El above, I was simply staggered. I watched in "
"horror as the poor clerk tried her best to respond in a far more befitting "
"way as this brutish Khajiit continuously rebuked all words of politeness. "
"After a few moments of cringing, I simply could not bear the weight of such "
"impropriety and had to leave the store, my pulse drumming from what I had "
"witnessed.\n"
"\n"
"My next sighting occurred while stopping at one of Alinor's many opulent "
"fountains. Soon after taking my seat on a nearby bench, I witnessed a hoard "
"of little Khajiits run to the fountain. My, there must have been at least "
"ten of them! Without any sense of control, all at once they plunged into the "
"crystal waters of the once tranquil fountain, splashing about in the most "
"barbaric of fashions. Their mother came up from behind, clucking her tongue "
"like a mad chicken. One by one, her children slowly stepped out from the "
"fountain, talking excitedly all the while.\n"
"\n"
"I had of course heard that Khajiit gave birth to litters, but I never "
"thought they would have so many children of the same age! I can see the "
"population rising among our furred allies tenfold every decade, what with "
"such … tendencies. Not to mention the control these mothers seem to have on "
"their children, apparently not thinking to teach them a modicum of manners.\n"
"\n"
"It was while I was sitting in shock, mouth agape, that the most perplexing "
"interaction occurred. Perhaps it was my blatant observation of his kind, but "
"a young Khajiit standing near decided to strike up conversation. I will not "
"do you disservice by writing this cretin's dialogue here, but I will tell "
"you that it involved the creation of children and how he would be willing to "
"render his \"\"services\"\" for such an activity. I turned ruby red as, in "
"face of such lewdness, I left at once.\n"
"\n"
"I of course need not remind my dear readers of the other reputations that I, "
"being a lawful citizen of Summerset, am not able to observe. Surely, had I "
"been able to risk my safety to observe more unsavory sections of the city, I "
"would have seen a rise in skooma trades and black-market deals. Yes, I only "
"have rumors to guide these claims, but the Khajiit are known for their "
"inclination toward the illegal. I have no doubt that crime statistics will "
"continuously rise, given their habitation of our beloved homeland.\n"
"\n"
"Let us hope that our leaders will soon see the error of their ways. Perhaps "
"these allies are necessary in the war effort, but we're fighting a battle "
"here on the very shores of our beloved island! A battle against brutish, "
"lewd, and often miscreant Khajiits who threaten to rot our society from the "
"inside out. With just one day's worth of observation, I can safely say that "
"all citizens have every right to be anxious!\n"
"\n"
"We must all rise together and petition for the return of our peaceful "
"seclusion. Appeal to our local leaders, inform your fellow citizens, and "
"keep an eye out for those who have already invaded our homelands. Keep a "
"tight hold of both your purses and children as you travel our once safe "
"streets. Don't allow apologists to sway you, dear readers. Know the truth, "
"written by my own, trusted hand!\n"
"\n"
"My next issue will continue my investigation, this time into the habits and "
"culture of the Wood Elves, our lesser kin. Be sure to purchase it so I can "
"continue my important work!"

"By Unknown\n"
"\n"
"My research has led me to seek out Ebon Stadmont, a forest of much rumor and "
"speculation, but little known fact. Specifically, my curiosity lies within "
"the mysterious language found throughout the forest, inscriptions etched "
"within decayed ruins. This language is unknown, unstudied, and largely "
"unquestioned. I suspect this has much to do with the hazards the forest "
"possesses, rather than an inability to properly research said language.\n"
"\n"
"The forest twists, in a way. Moves as you walk through it. You'll see your "
"destination, just over the foliage. Walk through one of the many archways, "
"only to find yourself in a completely new location than the one you set out. "
"It's some sort of teleportation magic at work, I suspect, though so seamless "
"one can hardly notice as it happens. \n"
"\n"
"The foliage is dense, bringing to mind a hedge maze more than a proper woods."
" It's obvious that someone, or something, designed this forest to be "
"sectioned off. For the explicit purpose, I believe, of keeping outsiders out."
" What connection these protective measures have with the language I plan to "
"study, I'm unsure. But perhaps, through my research, I can discover the "
"answer.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"My initial findings within Ebon Stadmont have been, as I've feared, "
"inconclusive. I had once believed the language to be similar in form to "
"Daedric, but all experimentation to that end have yielded no results. Though "
"this language may be similarly ancient, I do not believe it to have Daedric "
"origins. And so, I fear that I begin my studies from the ground up.\n"
"\n"
"The one blessing within this expedition has come from what I expected to be "
"our biggest stumbling block; the forest itself. Have the rumors been "
"exaggerated? All of our incidents with the forest's twisting nature have "
"been both few in number and minor inconveniences, at best. I've lost none of "
"my troupe, as I once feared I may, though I've ordered them to stick close "
"together.\n"
"\n"
"I feel a sense of acceptance. As if the forest has judged us worthy of "
"uncovering its mysteries. Or perhaps the magical protections here have waned "
"over time. Whatever the case, I don't plan to allow this good fortune to go "
"to waste. Set backs are no, I am determined to research this language.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Finally, the mysteries of this language begin to unfold. I was looking at it "
"all wrong, that was my problem. I only saw a language, consisting of mere "
"symbols. Something to be researched and translated. But these words have "
"power. I see that now.\n"
"\n"
"Within these inscriptions contain an untapped source of magical energy. But, "
"try as I may, I cannot find a way to release it. To use it, the way I feel "
"it so deeply wishes to be used. The kind of creative energy, full of an "
"untold potential. But of what?\n"
"\n"
"The words are alive. They speak to me sometimes, if I listen close. Words "
"whispered in my mind. The power that has laid dormant for so long, willing "
"itself back into existence. If only I could discover how."

"many among the town guard. I thought, perhaps, he intended to move heirlooms "
"abroad under cover of darkness. He led them all down into the family vaults. "
"It all seemed rather clandestine. I waited for nearly an hour by the window "
"in the dark, hoping to catch a glimpse of something that would make sense of "
"it, but when he reemerged he was alone.\n"

"I woke this morning to find the house guard posted by my door. I was "
"informed that my father has ordered the entire family to remain within the "
"manor until further notice. I did not receive the news graciously. I hoped "
"to appeal his tyrannical measure by planting myself before his chamber and "

"\n"
"I remember the day I received my calian with perfect clarity. This often "
"surprises people—particularly Men. While they drift through a fog of half-"
"remembered dreams, we Altmer remember everything. Every embrace, every "
"slight, every triumph and defeat lurks at the edge of our sight, frozen in "
"time—waiting to be recalled with unnerving accuracy. So now, when I say "
"perfect clarity, you take my meaning.\n"
"\n"
"I was a wiry youth of eighteen. The chapel smelled of incense and cherry-"
"blossoms, and my entire calan—mother, father, grandseers, and rumes—shuffled "
"in their pews, filled with nervous pride. The Ascendant Curate approached "
"slowly. A stole of swan feathers and dragontongue cascaded over her "
"shoulders, and upon her brow rested a grand welkyn wreath, bedecked in "
"driftwood and precious stones. She stopped just a finger's length away from "
"me and bade me to kneel. I did so, and she held my calian aloft. I saw it "
"glistening in the starlight above and suddenly realized I was crying. At "
"that time, the sphere was pristine—fashioned from milky aethequartz and sun-"
"blown glass. I remember thinking, \"\"How fragile a thing it is.\"\" Even "
"then, I knew its great value. After reciting the Athel Vialen, she placed "
"the sphere in my hands and smiled. I cradled it like a songbird just emerged "
"from its egg. In that moment, I swore an oath to protect it. But what does "
"an eighteen year-old know of oaths? Youth often makes a meal of the sacred. "
"Too often.\n"
"\n"
"I grew into an angry young Mer—disillusioned by the idle pride of my peers "
"and the sneering detachment of my elders. At fifty-two, I joined a crew of "
"privateers. We wreaked havoc on Redguard smugglers for thirteen years. As "
"time sailed on, our coffers swelled with foreign treasures. When we parted "
"company, each crewman enjoyed wealth beyond measure.\n"
"\n"
"In all my years on the sea, I never lost sight of my calian. It rested "
"beneath my bunk, safely tucked away in a willow-wood box. All the treasures "
"of Hammerfell fell short of its brilliance. All the pride of my noble race "
"found voice in its creamy luster.\n"
"\n"
"Determined to settle down, I sought out a parcel of land east of Alinor—a "
"vineyard of modest reputation. I offered a fortune in gold to the aging "
"vintner, but he refused to sell. With each passing day, my offers grew (as "
"did my impatience). Who was this decrepit Mer to stand in the way of my "
"happiness? What right did he have to deprive me of what I desired? At "
"length, I resolved to make this toothless Elf see reason. I rode out to his "
"residence on a rain-soaked evening, sabre in hand and wine on my breath. I "
"roused him from his sleep and barged into his cottage, shouting obscenities "
"and thrusting the bill of sale in his face. He shouted for me to leave, and "
"shoved his frail shoulder into my side—trying in vain to push me out the "
"door. A great drunken rage swelled in my chest, and without a second thought "
"I drove my sabre deep into his chest. It took only a moment to realize my "
"folly. I tumbled back against the wall and gazed in horror at his feeble "
"death throes. So deep and dark was my shame that I nearly took my own life "
"on the spot. But in the end, I resolved to present myself to the "
"Ascendants—to face my justice.\n"
"\n"
"The very curate who presented my calian as a youth sat in judgment. She "
"fixed her icy gaze upon me as I recounted the tale. When I finally fell "
"silent, she whispered something to her attending contemplative and rose to "
"meet me. The contemplative took my ornate willow-wood box and opened it to "
"reveal my calian—my great and perfect treasure. With the steady hands of a "
"jeweler, he plucked the sphere from its resting place and handed it to the "
"curate. She gazed at me with a combination of sorrow and wrath. In silence, "
"she held the calian aloft. My shoulders tightened as I dug my nails into my "
"palms. Finally, she whispered the damning phrase, \"\"Apraxis\"\" and let "
"the sphere slip through her fingers. I watched in horror as the precious "
"heirloom tumbled through space and time, then shattered upon the cold marble "
"floor. The curate and her contemplative turned their back, and lesser "
"contemplatives ushered me, and the broken shards of my calian, out into the "
"night.\n"
"\n"
"So began my life as an apraxic—a shamed outcast, left to contemplate the "
"enormity of my sins in silent reflection.\n"
"\n"
"For thirty years, I labored over the shattered remains of my blessed calian. "
"I spent the last of my gold gathering stone-cutting tools, pearl-powder "
"fixatives, and sacred oils. I ate little and slept not at all. My beard grew "
"long and my muscles withered. With each success came three new failures. And "
"all the while, my fellow Altmer spurned and cursed me.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, one bright morning in Second Seed, I set the last delicate shard of "
"glass in its place—returning the calian to its pristine origins. I felt such "
"a swell of relief in that moment that I wept like a babe. At length, I "
"washed myself in rosewater, sheared off my matted beard, and set out to the "
"Hall of High Ascendency.\n"
"\n"
"I approached the curate on unsteady legs, my eyes fixed on the floor in "
"deference. I opened my willow-wood box and held my calian up for inspection. "
"The eerie silence seemed to last forever as the curate and her contemplative "
"examined the sphere. Finally, I felt her hand upon my shoulder and heard her "
"soft whisper. \"\"Rise.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I reluctantly stood up and raised my eyes to meet hers.\n"
"\n"
"I could scarcely breathe when she spoke those long sought words: \"\"Welcome "
"back, lost son of Aldmeris.\"\""

"\n"
"This one need not tell you of High Elf pride and vanity. We have all seen "
"it, no? The disdain in their eyes, shining as bright as a counterfeit coin. "
"You have heard the condescension that drips from their tongue like honeyed "
"venom. Our tall allies think so little of us Khajiit. Time to prove them "
"wrong, walker. Let us beat them at their own game.\n"
"\n"
"If you have read my first volume of this series, you'll already have a good "
"idea of the importance that High Elves place on their history. We know this, "
"yes, but even this pride tends to pale next to the vanity the mer hold for "
"their familial past. Most know the name, occupation, and supposed greatness "
"of their ancestors dating back centuries. And they will be most keen to tell "
"you of them, this one assures you of that.\n"
"\n"
"Family is everything to the High Elves, but do not take that to be sentiment."
" It is chains that they bind themselves with, a title that is set in stone. "
"Only great feats can elevate them, and so they crave each day for that "
"moment of their apotheosis. Many choose to prove themselves through arcane "
"feats, as magic runs strong and often within their veins. Others throw "
"themselves within their art, hoping to paint a masterpiece of produce a "
"melody glorious enough to rise their status.\n"
"\n"
"Yes, the High Elves create great walls before themselves. Climb, they say! "
"But the way is often hard. Never have I seen such malice as that between "
"fellow artists here in Summerset. I've met thieves and assassins with more "
"curtesy towards their rivals! The mages look down upon all, but quickly grow "
"envious of their peers' power. Even among each other, the High Elves seek to "
"look from above.\n"
"\n"
"They care not for you, walker, nor your family. To them, we have but one "
"title. Khajiit. And thus we are lower, and thus we are useful only to be "
"used. This we know. To elevate yourself in the eyes of a High Elf, well, it "
"is not an easy feat. You must prove your worth, again and again. Exhausting "
"work for even the most diligent, but still, we must try. \n"
"\n"
"Bezumi has found many High Elves to be irresistible to challenges of skill. "
"Dangle a chance to prove themselves better, and always they will bite. We "
"know though, the honor that a cunning win still brings. Always make sure to "
"stock the odds within your favor, yes?\n"
"\n"
"Winning a challenge against a High Elf has always proven to have … mixed "
"results. Some will demand a rematch, so wounded is their pride. Others will "
"throw a most vivid tantrum and storm off, declaring you a cheat. But there "
"will be an honorable few who shall bow their head and concede defeat. Within "
"them will alight a small flame of respect. Let us fan those flames.\n"
"\n"
"Despite this one's advice and encouragement, she knows that not every High "
"Elf can be won over. Many have become blind and deaf to all but their own "
"opinion. Do not let them dishearten you, walker. Do not let them win. Let "
"them come at us with their venom, with their ignorance. We must be the ones "
"to change, yes, but into something better. Into something greater."

"\n"
"Summerset was a very different place when the early Aldmer first stepped "
"upon its pristine shores. Different creatures roamed the island, some "
"fearsome, some benign. The early Aldmer, ever thorough when it came to "
"cleansing the environment of unwanted threats, set out to completely "
"exterminate welwas—a creature they, for some reason lost to the historical "
"record, totally despised. In a few short years, welwas were driven to "
"extinction and removed from the Summerset ecology.\n"
"\n"
"According to ancient writings, the welwas sought the demise of the newly "
"arrived Aldmer. Along with the gheatus and the ilyadi, the welwas attacked "
"the Aldmer. Using ancestral lore and power drawn from the stars, the Aldmer "
"used lightning, ice, and fire to utterly destroy these ravaging creatures.\n"
"\n"
"Summerset art and sculpture depicts welwas as strange, holy beasts with "
"horns and savage teeth. In fact, due to these representations, many scholars "
"believed that the entire species was extinct and a few considered the "
"creatures to be nothing more than myths and legends. Imagine our surprise "
"when entire herds were discovered roaming the Craglorn region of eastern "
"Hammerfell, and in sufficient numbers to make a reintroduction program not "
"only feasible but totally within the realm of distinct possibility.\n"
"\n"
"It was with great pride that I took on the project of reintroducing welwas "
"into the Summerset environment. We started modestly at first, gathering six "
"mated pairs from the wilds of Craglorn. After a period of quarantine to make "
"sure the creatures were healthy and bonded to their counterparts, my team "
"and I released them in the northwest swamps. They immediately took to the "
"region and, after three additional expeditions to acquire more welwas, the "
"welwa packs appeared healthy and vibrant. I was even able to witness one of "
"the first welwa births on Summerset in modern times. It was a glorious "
"experience!\n"
"\n"
"Of course, not everyone agreed with the goals of this ambitious undertaking. "
"Even some of my esteemed colleagues among the Sapiarchs protested that "
"returning such a savage beast into an environment we tamed long ago was not "
"only foolhardy, it was dangerous. To these critics I repeat the old adage, "
"\"\"anything worth doing involves some level of risk.\"\" I was disheartened "
"by the number of level-headed Altmer who showed up to demonstrate their "
"disapproval as the ship carrying the first mated pairs of welwas pulled up "
"to the dock. Luckily, the Divine Prosecution and the city guards were on "
"hand to maintain order and make sure no one tried to harm the majestic "
"creatures.\n"
"\n"
"Now, despite some continuing protests and a few legal actions aimed at "
"altering the plan I championed and put in place, packs of welwas once again "
"run free in the Summerset wilderness. Thanks to the Sapiarchs, the island is "
"one step closer to returning to its original splendor. Now if only I could "
"figure out how to restore the gheatus and the ilyadi."

"Chapter Forty-Seven: Altmeric Rites of Martial Contest\n"
"\n"
"Despite our majestic Aedric heritage, we Altmer are not immune to the "
"mundane, worldly tensions that plague the affairs of lesser races. Wisdom "
"and prudence dictate that simple disagreements are best settled through "
"dialogue. Long and thorough consideration, combined with wine and fellowship "
"often yield reconciliation in short order. Alas, some indignities cut so "
"deeply that an honorable martial contest is the only route to rapprochement. "
"In such cases, the aggrieved parties must abide by the following rules.\n"
"\n"
"1. Both parties must arm themselves with a traditional Altmer dueling foil. "
"long swords, axes, flails and the like are not permitted by the sacred laws "
"of Trinimac. Foils must be washed in mineral water, thoroughly dried, and "
"well-polished.\n"
"\n"
"2. Prior to the duel, both parties must recite their adversary's full "
"name—taking care to call upon matrilineal, patrilineal, and clan honorifics "
"where appropriate. Duelists who stumble over or mispronounce their "
"adversary's name must stop and recite the name in its totality twice more.\n"
"\n"
"3. Duelists must ensure that a second is present for the duel. These "
"witnesses are honor-bound to intervene should one of the aggrieved parties "
"commit an honor-infraction such as casting dirt in their opponent's eyes, "
"fleeing the field prior to the duel's conclusion, or using venomous words "
"that might further inflame tensions between parties.\n"
"\n"
"The victorious duelist must engage with their defeated opponent in a "
"courteous and humble fashion—availing them of family physicians, bandages, "
"or any other appropriate service to dress their wounds. Defeated duelists "
"are likewise required to admit error, and humbly request forgiveness for "
"their actions. If the parties follow these rules, both emerge from the "
"conflict with honor intact. And this is good, for nothing on Nirn counts "
"more than honor."

"After a recent discussion with a self-proclaimed \"\"priest and scholar\"\" "
"of the Tribunal Temple, I find myself shamed (as I often am), but not "
"surprised (as I never am) by the gross misunderstandings of the nature of "
"the Daedra that \"\"adopted\"\" our ancestors. It seems that our priests "
"these days are trained in little more than bland recitations and methods for "
"parting pilgrims from their gold, a significant and disappointing departure "
"from their traditional functions. Some may consider this blasphemy. I invite "
"them to challenge me to debate—or magical contest, if they prefer. Though I "
"do not often concern myself with society, someone must battle the tide of "
"ignorance.\n"
"\n"
"I do not expect every Dunmer to attain understanding comparable to my own. "
"Indeed, the common Elf has his place minding the mundane details of our "
"race's day-to-day survival. Even so, laziness in any respect is abhorrent, "
"and intellectual complacency cannot be permitted even among the lower "
"echelons. Allow me to provide an accessible examination of the Good Daedra, "
"beginning with the most easily misunderstood: Mephala.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Good\"\" is an ill-suited descriptor for any Daedric being, and it is "
"unfortunate it has come into casual use. As absolute expressions of their "
"respective spheres, the Daedric Princes do not share our moral "
"categorizations for behavior. The Daedra simply are. Mephala, Boethiah, and "
"Azura have done much for the interests of the Dunmer, and in that sense they "
"may appear to be good, but their motivations and goals (and the consequences "
"of achieving them) are not known to us.\n"
"\n"
"There's a reason Mephala is referred to as the \"\"Webspinner,\"\" though "
"modern Dunmer seem to ignore this appellation and instead project the "
"sympathetic qualities they associate with Vivec—art in violence, cunning, "
"enlightened poetry—back onto the Daedric being that \"\"anticipated\"\" him. "
"This tendency serves to conceal much of Mephala's nature, which is exactly "
"what the Prince would desire.\n"
"\n"
"Mephala taught our ancestors the ways of secret murder, to be used against "
"our enemies and even against our own in the place of all-out war, certainly "
"\"\"good\"\" for our predecessors as they migrated across Tamriel and came "
"into often-fractious contact with the Nords and Dwemer. We learned "
"meticulous plotting and how to lie, ways to lure and trap our foes, how to "
"manage complexity and predict outcomes. But few ask why this Daedric Prince "
"would champion our people. The gullible fancy us chosen for our superior "
"qualities and the cynical believe us a mere amusement for the Daedra, but "
"these are both woefully simple-minded theories.\n"
"\n"
"We must keep in mind that the Daedra are incapable of creation. They can "
"only imitate, manipulate, and exaggerate. Some of them do perceive mortals "
"as mere playthings, but I do not suspect this of Mephala. She does nothing "
"without purpose, perceives all of Aurbis as an interconnected system of "
"action and consequence, and employs herself in spinning new threads to "
"influence outcomes.\n"
"\n"
"To what end? That you must work out for yourself (as I have). Do you think "

"데이드라에게는 창조력이 없는 것을 잊어서는 안된다. 그들이 가능한 것은 모방과 조작된 과장 뿐이다. 그 중에는 선택받은자를 단지 하나의 "
"도구로 생각하는 자도 있지만, 메팔라는 해당하지 않을 것이다. 그녀의 행동에는 반드시 의미가 있다. 어비스 전체를 인과(원인과 결과)로 "

"On the Sload and the Maormer: The Sload are hostile to all other mortal "
"races, and though there is some evidence of diplomatic traffic between the "
"Sload and the Maormer, there are also plenty of accounts of conflict between "
"the Slugmen and the Sea Elves. This is no surprise, since both Sea Elves and "
"Sload are at war with the rest of the world. The Maormer's grievance seems "
"to be that they got stuck with Pyandonea, a sad and swampy archipelago of "
"malodorous islets; why the Sload are so belligerent to all others is unknown."
" \n"
"\n"
"On the Coral Tower: Since the Coral Tower fell during the invasion of Thras "
"by the All-Flags Navy, at this point the best we can do is make educated "
"guesses about it. In their own perverse way, the Sload are very capable "
"sorcerers, and from all accounts the Coral Tower acted as both a focus and a "
"projector of mystical power. I am not a scholar of Tower Lore—my interests "
"tend more toward the practical—but this accords (somewhat) with what the "
"mythohistorians claim is the purpose and practice of the so-called Towers of "
"Nirn. Was the Coral Tower a \"\"real\"\" tower like Lawful Crystal, here on "
"Summerset, or was it a failed imitation, like the Doomspire? I do not think "
"we have the answers based on what little we know. \n"
"\n"
"On Sload Soap: But enough speculation—on to a subject about which, for once, "
"we can be certain: Sload Soap! There are many misconceptions about the "
"origin of Sload Soap, and I am happy to have an opportunity to clear it up. "
"First, let us consider the metamorphic biology of the Sload. They begin life "
"on the Thrassian Atolls as, in the words of Admiral Bendu Olo, "
"\"\"disgusting little amorphous grubs.\"\" Ignored by their pendulous "
"parents, these grubs somehow squirm their way to the sea, where they mutate "
"into aquatic quasi-cephalopods known as \"\"polwygles.\"\" Due to their "
"corpulence, adult Sload spend a great deal of time in the shallow lagoons of "
"their atolls, wallowing among the polwygles. Those larvae that prove too "
"slow to avoid their parents' pseudopods are caught and harvested, culling "
"out the weak and providing the raw material for Sload Soap.\n"
"\n"
"Captured polwygles are tossed into an ever-bubbling cauldron where they "
"gradually deliquesce into a slimy broth. This broth undergoes an alchemical "
"commixture with materials known only to the Sload, after which it is poured "
"into molds and allowed to cool. Once solid, the bars are scooped out and "
"wrapped in the viscera of hagfish for preservation.\n"
"\n"
"It is believed that the Sload use this soap as a primary component in their "
"necromantic rituals. I'm no expert on necromancy, but apparently having an "
"emulsified reagent concocted from one's own descendants acts as a profound "
"intensifier in the magic of undeath. Sload Soap is rarely seen away from "
"Thras, and when it is it commands high prices from alchemists, who relish "
"its unique properties for creating potions of agility and, rarest of all, "
"the mutation of personality. Alianora the Red, our Sapiarch of Alchemy, says "
"that Sload Soap has never been thoroughly analyzed outside of Thras, and may "
"contain many more undiscovered alchemical properties. Plus, it's an "
"exceptional cleanser, deep-cleaning yet mild, that leaves your skin feeling "
"youthful and refreshed."

"the raw concepts to utilize it. The language itself is undeniably connected "
"in a fundamental way to magical energies, though its origin remains a "
"mystery.\n"
"\n"
"As an aside for prospective students of Enchanting, do not become "
"discouraged when you encounter a rune you are unable to decipher. Only "
"through repetition of words and phrases you have learned and the extraction "
"of runes from glyphs will you obtain the knowledge you need to master more "
"difficult runes. Be patient and work with other students to create and "
"deconstruct glyphs to gain more insight into their interplay and true "
"meaning.\n"
"\n"
"Language, specifically the written word, is also of critical importance to "
"the Altmer. Not only does it preserve our history, but it captures and "
"defines our auspicious lineage and ensures that every Mer knows his or her "
"place in the hierarchy. It is no accident that Altmeri society is the most "
"orderly and structured in Tamriel—it is the will of Xarxes himself. The "
"scholar-priests of the divine scribe, secretive though they are, are said to "
"preserve an ancient tongue long forgotten to any but their order. In "
"Helaameril's \"\"Conversations with the Etymon-Binders,\"\" an anonymous "
"scribe hints at tomes capable of producing tastes, smells, dancing images, "
"and texts that can be read by any gazing upon them—even the unlettered. "
"Another form of word-magic, if Helaameril is to be believed.\n"
"\n"
"Consider even what may seem mundane: the speech of a great general upon the "
"morn of battle that rouses his troops to perform incredible deeds, the songs "
"of a master bard that inspire emotion, the calming tone of a mother to her "
"child. Are there traces of magic in everyday exertions of will through "
"speech or writing? It seems possible that some remnant of ancient pre-Dawn "
"power lingers on here, though it has grown faint. There is even more "
"evidence to support this throughout the history of Tamriel—far too much to "
"detail here—and I look forward to debating this theory among my peers."

"Exposing the Secretive Author of the popular Investigator Vale mysteries,\n"
"By Adandora, Chronicler at Large\n"
"\n"
"The popular mystery novels detailing the cases of Investigator Vale have "
"sold millions of copies. The adventures of the famous Breton detective are "
"as sought-after in Windhelm and Skywatch as they are in Daggerfall. However, "
"unlike other authors, the creator of Investigator Vale refuses to share the "
"stage with her amazing heroine. In fact, her identity has remained anonymous "
"and unknown—until now.\n"
"\n"
"This chronicler-at-large began researching this mystery after hearing the "
"story of a former member of the Ring of Daggers, the intelligence branch of "
"the Daggerfall Covenant. This former member, according to the story, was not "
"only a master spy, but a formidable detective, a consummate warrior, and a "
"daring adventurer. The more I researched this remarkable woman, the more she "
"reminded me of the fictitious Vale. I had to meet this woman, so I began my "
"hunt for Arabelle Davaux.\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle Davaux was born in Wayrest in 2E 527. She grew up in a noble "
"household, attending the best schools in High Rock. A rambunctious youth and "
"rebellious teenager, she ran away from home at the age of fifteen to join a "
"mercenary group that helped defend High Rock from the invading horde that "
"stormed out of the Reach. She went on to fight in a number of battles across "
"the continent before finding a place with the Lion Guard. By 2E 560, she had "
"earned the rank of captain and commanded a squad of the Lion Guard's finest "
"soldiers. That's where she first came to the attention of Emeric, king of "
"Wayrest and future high king of the Daggerfall Covenant.\n"
"\n"
"Now, Arabelle's exploits read like the most outrageous of Vale's stories. "
"She was reported to have dispatched bandit lords, marauding trolls, and "
"enemy forces with style and panache, and rumors indicated she had multiple "
"lovers of all races and genders in a dozen different town, cities, and ports "
"of call. Life was her adventure, and she rushed to meet it the way she "
"charged to meet every enemy in battle. Scandalous tales even connect her to "
"High King Emeric in a romantic fashion, especially during the year she "
"served on his personal guard. Whatever the truth of it, it's obvious that "
"Arabelle impressed Emeric, and when he forged the Ring of Daggers, she was "
"one of his first recruits.\n"
"\n"
"When Arabelle turned fifty, she decided it was time to start a new chapter "
"in her life. She graciously resigned from the Ring of Daggers and took up "
"the role of a world traveler, finally getting to leisurely visit people and "
"places she used to only get to see as part of her job. Claiming she was now "
"\"\"too old\"\" to deal with intrigue, spycraft, and rumors of war, Arabelle "
"became a lady of leisure, securing suites and spending long and luxorious "
"weeks in one exotic location after another. I caught up with her in the city "
"of the Orcs, Orsinium.\n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: Arabelle Davaux, it's a pleasure to meet you after all the "
"amazing stories I read. Did you really take down four river trolls "
"singlehandedly to stop the attacks against the people of Kerbol's Hollow?\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle: Actually, it was six swamp trolls, but I didn't want to seem like "
"I was bragging in the official report.\n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: You've led a remarkable life. Mercenary, adventurer, soldier, "
"spy. Now I understand you have a new passion. Care to tell my readers all "
"about it?\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle: My passion is travel and sightseeing, but if your readers want to "
"hear about my adventures as a tour guide ….\n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: Don't play coy, Lady Arabelle. You know exactly which passion "
"I'm referring to. And it begins with Investigator Vale.\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle: Ah, well, I suppose you've found me out. I have grown rather fond "
"of those daring stories of crime and drama. And, I'm not ashamed to say, I "
"love how bawdy the investigator can be. Gets my old blood boiling, if you "
"know what I mean!\n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: Come, come, Lady Arabelle. Admit it! You're the author of the "
"Investigator Vale books!\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle: Author? Me? Do these elegant fingers look cramped and strained "
"from holding a quill for hours at a time? Do you see any ink stains on my "
"hands?\n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: But isn't it true that you modeled Vale after your own exploits? "
"That it's a thinly veiled autobiography of your time as a spy for High King "
"Emeric?\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle: What an imagination you have, chronicler! Are you sure you aren't "
"the author of Vale's amazing adventures? \n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: Me? Don't be absurd! I report the news, not create elaborate "
"fictions!\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle: If you say so, my dear.\n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: But isn't it true that you still dabble in solving mysteries? "
"That you choose places to visit based on what crimes and conspiracies are "
"currently confounding local authorities?\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle: Do I? I hadn't noticed.\n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: My gods! You practically admitted you played \"\"sheathe the "
"dagger\"\" with High King Emeric in \"\"Investigator Vale and the High Rock "
"Revolt!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle: I did no such thing! And besides, Emeric's dagger would more "
"accurately be described as a sword ….\n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: See! You did it again!\n"
"\n"
"Arabelle: Write whatever you feel you must, dear. As for me, I'm late for "
"dinner with Captain Ghorza of the Orsinium Guard. It's been a long time "
"since I enjoyed the company of a lascivious Orc. And I hear she's been "
"having trouble catching a museum thief.\n"
"\n"
"Chronicler: There you have it, faithful reader. Lady Arabelle confessed to "
"being the author of the Investigator Vale mysteries! I solved a case worthy "
"of the famous detective herself!"

"\"\"What? Who said—? This one isn't—,\"\" Zar sputtered. Then he said "
"quietly, \"\"When did you figure it out?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Really, Zar?\"\" Vale teased. \"\"The tales of Zaraki-dar, Ear of the "

"\"\"\n"

"\"\"People always tell Zar how much they appreciate his furry, well-rounded "
"… head,\"\" Zaraki mused as he hurried to catch up with Investigator Vale.\n"

"back of Vale's long coat.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Vale and Zaraki-dar made their way cautiously into the coral forest outside "
"Shimmerene as dusk began to creep across the sky. The dense collection of "
"petrified coral created a strange, labyrinthine landscape along the island's "
"eastern shore. Clues on the parchment sheet had led them here. A few steps "
"into the area and they could hear ominous chanting echoing off the coral "
"protrusions closing in around them. The unknown words had a sharp edge to "
"them that made Vale's skin crawl and Zaraki's fur stand on end.\n"
"\n"
"They walked deeper into the coral maze, eyes alert and searching. Flickering "
"firelight danced behind one of the coral pillars, so Vale proceeded in that "
"direction. Zaraki rested a paw on her shoulder, silently urging caution. She "
"nodded and peered around the pillar.\n"

"In a clearing at the center of the coral forest, the High Elf wearing the "
"Mephala medallion they encountered in the old book shop stood before an "
"abstract yet disturbingly asymmetrical three-sided shrine that bore Daedric "
"symbols associated with three different Princes. She gazed into the fires "
"burning in the three braziers as she chanted the same phrase over and over. "
"Behind her, the air shimmered and glowed with a strange, unnatural light. "
"Something was coming! Before Vale could act, a tiny spider scurried off her "
"back and rushed toward the cultist, growing larger until it was about the "
"size of a cat when it climbed onto her shoulder.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You're just in time,\"\" the High Elf said with obvious disdain. \"\"You "
"can be the first of the lesser races to experience the majesty and power of "
"the Altmer reborn!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Hey, Zaraki-dar,\"\" Vale asked, \"\"you have any idea what this "
"overblown, pointed-eared, Daedra-loving idiot is talking about?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Not a clue, pretty lady,\"\" Zar replied. \"\"This one doesn't like the "
"looks of that shrine, though. Zar does not believe it is strictly legal.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Well, then,\"\" Vale said, and she took two steps forward and kicked the "
"makeshift shrine with her heavy leather boot. It shattered, scattering the "
"three small braziers and extinguishing two of the three small fires.\n"
"\n"
"The cultist screamed in rage as the glow behind her faded and the air "
"stopped shimmering. She drew a long, curved dagger from her robe as the "
"spider on her shoulder reared up and clacked its mandibles.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"None of that Daedric nonsense from you,\"\" Zaraki-dar said as he drew "
"his own sword and stepped in front of Vale. \"\"By order of the Queen, this "
"one accepts your surrender!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"With that, a dozen Dominion soldiers rushed into the clearing to surround "
"the cultist, each brandishing a weapon. The cultist and the spider looked "
"around, then she dropped her dagger and the spider settled back down.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"This isn't over, cat,\"\" the High Elf cultist spat.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Oh, I think it is,\"\" Vale countered cheerfully, \"\"at least as far as "
"you're concerned.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Vale leaned back against her pillow, looking up into the dark room above the "
"inn. \"\"Do you think there are more of them out there, Zar?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Zaraki-dar, one hand holding up his head as the other stroked Vale's naked "
"thigh. \"\"There are always more, pretty lady. That's why the queen keeps me "
"around.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Well, then, I won't worry about it right now. I'd much rather have "
"another go at your tawny, furry …\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Zar kissed her, cutting off Vale's words. She returned the favor."

"Dearest Niece,\n"
"\n"
"What a profound delight to hear from you! And five-fold felicitations on "
"your glorious Aednavorith attestation! Your mother could barely contain her "
"excitement on her last visit. How wonderful that your results surpassed even "
"her wildest imaginings. As for me, I never had any doubt. We come from a "
"prestigious line, and despite your father's ancestral deficiencies, I knew "
"you would take on the finest aspects of our noble kin. I hear that your skin "
"color and ear-shape reports were particularly favorable. What a relief! As "
"we all know, ear-related flaws run deep in your father's line. How fortunate "
"that you danced around that snare!\n"
"\n"
"Now, to business! In reference to your question, yes, our estate sponsors "
"several fine young Mer of impeccable breeding. I will describe them here in "
"detail, and attach their various attestations for you to peruse. I'm "
"confident you'll find a worthy mate among them.\n"
"\n"
"The first is Talanor—a truly handsome Mer with ties to the prestigious "
"Enruneldinion line. He enjoys the benefits of exceptional height, and the "
"amber eyes characteristic of his father's descent. He suffers only minor "
"flaws in skin color and jaw width, but these are easily overlooked, and "
"likely recessive in nature. He knows his letters very well and excels in all "
"schools of arcane practice. You won't find a more skillful mage at this age. "
"A fine and dignified match, I assure you.\n"
"\n"
"Next is Hiruyon, son of Helebrim. You no doubt recognize the name. Helebrim "
"is one of Summerset's foremost composers—the kind of musical genius that "
"arrives only once in a generation. Hiruyon, to his great credit, possesses "
"many of his father's finer qualities. His singing voice is the envy of Mara "
"herself, and he plays no less than twelve instruments. Alas, his physical "
"qualities fall short of stellar. His facial symmetry leaves something to be "
"desired, due in large part to his smallish eyes. He also suffers from a "
"slight enlargement at the bridge of the nose—a trait indicative of cross-"
"breeding with Men. I leave it to you to decide if such physical deficiencies "
"overwhelm his ample talents and charming disposition. At the very least, his "
"paternal accolades will serve you well at court.\n"
"\n"
"We come at last to my favorite of the bunch: Pelanrel. Call me shallow if "
"you wish! This fiery youth rivals Trinimac himself in terms of appearance "
"and temperament. His countenance bears an uncanny resemblance to our Aldmeri "
"forebears. Truly, he could have walked off a kinlord's tapestry. Wide almond "
"eyes, ears as sharp as daggers, and the narrow, hawk-like aspect of our "
"ancient kin. Marvelous! He displays great strength and speed on the sparring "
"ground and the gaming field, and took to smithing like a lark to the wind. "
"His only shortcomings lie in his magical and scholarly aptitude. But I have "
"confidence that our shared ancestry would easily overcome such a weakness.\n"
"\n"
"Write me back without delay, dearest niece! I'm anxious to find out which of "
"these fine stallions you find most intriguing. If we move quickly, we may "
"have a new child to spoil within the year!\n"
"\n"

"Investigator Vale sat at a small table in the intoxicant lounge, sipping "
"golden wine from an ornate flute of glistening glass. The lounge window "
"looked out upon one of Shimmerene's main streets, allowing her to watch the "
"High Elves saunter past as she contemplated the events that occurred aboard "
"the Silver Swan. These cultists calling themselves the Retinue of Shambles "
"concerned her more than she had let on, especially considering that the "
"group appeared to consist of multiple Daedric factions come together for "
"some sinister purpose—a purpose, she realized, that threatened not only "
"Summerset but perhaps the entire world.\n"
"\n"
"This was definitely not the sort of thing that Vale usually dealt with, but "
"she didn't see anyone else in the vicinity who was volunteering to step "
"forward. And she thought her trip to Summerset was going to be mostly "
"uneventful and relaxing.\n"
"\n"
"The Khajiit who claimed to be a simple clothier strode over and deposited "
"himself in the empty chair across from Vale. \"\"Zaraki sees that you have "
"started without him,\"\" Zaraki said as he poured wine into his own flute. "
"\"\"This one shall endeavor to catch up, quick, quick!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Vale clinked her glass to his and took a long drink of the effervescent wine."
" \"\"I hate to admit it, but I'm out of my element in this foreign land,\"\" "
"she said. \"\"All of my usual contacts and avenues of research are across "
"the sea and far away. I need to figure out how to find out more about this "
"so-called Retinue of Shambles.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Do not worry, pretty lady,\"\" Zaraki said jovially. \"\"This one might "
"know a person or two who can help us with this situation.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Us?\"\" asked Vale suspiciously. \"\"That brings me back to my original "
"question. Just who in Oblivion are you really, Zaraki-dar?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"This one is offended by your accusing tone, investigator, but also "
"pleased by your use of the honorific at the end of my name. Zar thinks it "
"sounds very, very good. But there are cultists to deal with, yes?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Oh, very well,\"\" Vale said grudgingly, \"\"Take me to your contacts "
"here in Summerset. I'm quite certain your cloth provider and button merchant "
"can tell us all about Daedric cult activity on the island.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You'd be surprised what you can learn when you ask the right questions "
"of the right people, pretty lady. Stay close and let Zar show you how it's "
"done!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"Four hours later, after following Zaraki into every storefront, tavern, and "
"back alley in Shimmerene, Vale had to admit that the Khajiit knew how to get "
"people to talk. He was charming and disarming, but also scary and "
"threatening, depending on who we were dealing with and what was called for "
"to get them to open up. She wasn't going to stroke his fur, but she was "
"impressed by his technique. Still, other than some vague rumors and a few "
"outrageous claims, they weren't any closer to finding the Retinue of "
"Shambles. Then they stepped into an unassuming shop filled with scrolls, "
"manuscripts, and extremely old books.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Lentelfan!\"\" Zar called into the quiet stacks of paper. \"\"It is your "
"old friend, Zaraki, come for a visit!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Someone stepped out from behind one of the high shelves. It was a High Elf "
"woman with long, dark hair, dressed in a noble's finery. A medallion hung "
"from a chain around her neck. It depicted a spider spinning a web. It was a "
"beautiful design, but for some reason it set Vale's teeth on edge.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Lentelfan no longer owns this fine establishment,\"\" the High Elf said. "
"\"\"Perhaps there's something I can help you with, though I sincerely doubt "
"it. I don't usually trade with people of your caliber.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Listen here, you self-important—\"\" Vale snapped as she moved to "
"confront the woman, but Zaraki's strong arm held her back.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Your mangy cat knows his place, Breton,\"\" the High Elf sneered. "
"\"\"You would do well to learn yours.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"A thousand pardons, esteemed one,\"\" Zaraki purred, bowing low to the "
"High Elf as he stepped between the two women. He continued to lay on a thick "
"and intricate apology as Vale fell back and used the opportunity to better "
"survey the area.\n"
"\n"
"Investigator Vale's gaze fell upon a small desk buried under stacks of "
"parchment and dozens of rolled scrolls. One sheet in particular caught "
"Vale's attention. It appeared to be a list of names and locations, a few of "
"which she recognized from her studies of Summerset maps when she was "
"preparing for her trip. The sheet also contained symbols that Vale couldn't "
"decipher. She made sure that Zaraki was blocking the High Elf's line of "
"sight as she slipped the parchment sheet into the inner pocket of her long "
"coat.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I'm bored, Zar,\"\" Vale said, tossing her long raven hair and setting "
"her full lips into a pout. \"\"You promised me dinner and a fine bottle of "
"wine, and this doesn't look at all like the restaurants we have back in "
"Daggerfall.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The two companions exited the shop quickly, serendipitously glancing back to "
"make sure the High Elf wasn't following.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Do you know who you almost picked a fight with, Vale?\"\" Zaraki asked.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Judging from the medallion, a high priest of Mephala,\"\" Vale said. "
"\"\"And a remarkably rude one at that. But I found something that might give "
"us some insight into what's going on around here, provided you know someone "
"who can read Daedric script.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"This one knows a great many experts in a great many things.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Vale smiled at the Khajiit and took his paw in her hand. \"\"I think I may "
"be beginning to like you, Zaraki-dar.\"\" She heard him purr at the mention "
"of the honorific. \n"
"\n"
"Neither of them noticed the tiny spiders following in their wake."

"\n"
"I just received your letter from the post in Alinor. To answer your "
"question, yeah, the trade's been good since the Elf-Queen's mandate. Better "
"than good. These Tall Elves are a pompous bunch, but gold's gold, and they "
"pay better than most. That said, sailing around Summerset's no roll in the "
"daisies. I know you can't navigate worth a damn, so you'd best pick up a "
"sailing master on your next trip to Sentinel.\n"
"\n"
"First thing you've got to know about sailing near Summerset is that it's "
"bigger than it looks. A lot bigger. For most folk, the island looks "
"downright inviting—white sandy beaches, sweet-smelling blossoms, freshwater "
"springs and the like. But what they don't see is the nest of crags and reefs "
"just beneath the surface of the water—all covered in corals. And I'm not "
"talking about the flimsy echatere-antlers you see in the Topal Bay. I'm "
"talking about massive sea-bones—bleached corals that are hard as Mauloch's "
"chin and sharp as Mehrunes' Razor. Just one of those scarps can split a hull "
"like a flay-knife through pig-skin, so sharp eyes and long wicks, eh? Mind "
"your maps and draft.\n"
"\n"
"Then there are the pirates. Damned Sea Elves. Can't go a day without "
"spotting their serpent-banners fluttering over a sunken merchantman or "

"The Wood Elf sprawled across the bed in the pristine cabin, a dagger "
"protruding from his chest and a pool of blood spreading beneath him. "
"\"\"Murder, Vale?\"\" said Nemdalan, High Elf captain of the Silver Swan "
"sailing ship, obviously hoping she would change her declaration to something "
"less sinister. \"\"Are you absolutely certain?'\n"
"\n"
"Investigator Vale sighed. \"\"Do you think he accidentally plunged the blade "
"into his own heart, Captain Nemdalan? I suppose it could be possible, but I "
"find it highly unlikely.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Firrinor, a Wood Elf brew master looking to take advantage of Queen Ayrenn's "
"proclamation that opened the borders of Summerset, would have been one of "
"the first of the new immigrants to step foot upon the High Elf homeland. "
"Now, he was nothing more than a memory in Valenwood and a guest at Y'ffre's "
"campfire. The investigator bent closer to examine the hilt and pommel "
"protruding from the brewer's chest.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"It had to be one of those high-and-mighty High Elves, yes?\"\" said "
"Zaraki, the Khajiit clothier. \"\"Despite Queen Ayrenn's promises, they "
"don't want the likes of us to sully their pristine island.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Perhaps,\"\" said Vale, using the light of a candle to better study the "
"intricate carvings that decorated the handle of the murder weapon. \"\"But I "
"find the use of a ceremonial dagger rather significant. Daedric, I believe. "
"I don't recognize all of these symbols, though the pattern suggests the "
"adoration of multiple Princes. Intriguing.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"So what are you saying, Vale? We're scheduled to dock in Shimmerene "
"tomorrow morning!\"\" Captain Nemdalan sputtered.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I'm saying, my dear captain, that you have not only a murderer aboard "
"your vessel—you have a murderer who's also a Daedric cultist, and those tend "
"to be the most intriguing kind,\"\" Vale said, hardly bothering to hide her "
"enthusiasm. \"\"Now this voyage is finally getting interesting!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Vale and the Khajiit clothier searched the ship's deepest hold, exploring "
"the narrow spaces between the crates, kegs, and barrels piled from deck to "
"ceiling. \"\"You didn't have to accompany me, Zaraki,\"\" the investigator "
"said, bemused. \"\"I'm quite capable of taking care of myself, you know.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Zar meant no disrespect, investigator,\"\" Zaraki replied as he brushed "
"cobwebs from his tawny fur. \"\"But this one didn't feel right allowing you "
"to descend into the bowels of this ship all by yourself. Not with a murderer "
"on the loose. Why the captain and his cowardly crew didn't volunteer to help "
"you, only Jode and Jone know for sure!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Vale squeezed through the gap between two stacks of crates and led the way "
"into a small clearing in the middle of the forest of cargo. She noticed that "
"one of the stacks was balanced precariously, as the bindings supporting it "
"had come loose during the voyage. She stepped gingerly past the unstable "
"stack to stand in the center of the cleared space.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Precisely where I expected to find it,\"\" she said triumphantly, "
"pointing to a makeshift shrine to one of the Daedric Princes. \"\"The god of "
"pledges and promises, if I remember my lessons with the headmaster of "
"Daedric studies at the University of Gwylim.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Zaraki circled the rune-covered deck and the Daedric symbol rising from its "
"center cautiously. \"\"You attended the university?'\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Well, let's just say I audited a few private lessons with the "
"headmaster,\"\" Vale said slyly. \"\"She learned as much from me as I "
"learned from her, I'm proud to admit.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"As the Khajiit reached a furred hand toward the skull-topped wooden plinth "
"surrounded by vile runes, the investigator slapped it away and motioned him "
"to be quiet. Footsteps were approaching the hidden shrine. Vale and Zaraki "
"pressed into the shadows cast by the close-packed crates and waited. A "
"moment passed, and then a tall High Elf in noble garb emerged from a gap "
"between the stacks.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I take it you're our Daedric cultist?\"\" Vale asked as she stepped into "
"the surprised High Elf's path.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Lord of Trickery take you!\"\" he shouted as he drew a wickedly curved "
"dagger from his belt. \"\"You should have never gotten involved in the "
"affairs of the Retinue of Shambles, Breton tramp!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Before Vale could respond, Zaraki leaped into action. The clothier "
"brandished a sword from who knew where and blocked the cultist's dagger "
"thrust. \"\"That is no way to treat a lady!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The cultist pointed his dagger at the Khajiit and began to cast a spell. Not "
"waiting for him to finish, Vale planted her expensive leather boot into the "
"small of the High Elf's back. The kick knocked him sideways, into the "
"unsecured stack of crates. The crates clattered to the deck, crushing the "
"cultist beneath them.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Damn!\"\" Vale said, blowing a loose strand of hair out of her eyes. "
"\"\"I didn't think the entire pile was going to come down! I can't get "
"answers out of a dead man!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"At least that will be an end to the murders, yes?\"\" Zaraki said.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"He mentioned the Retinue of Shambles,\"\" Vale replied. \"\"I have a "
"feeling this was just the beginning.\"\" Investigator Vale paused, looking "
"the Khajiit over appraisingly. \"\"And something tells me you aren't a "
"simple clothier, Zar.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I'm not? This one has no idea what you're implying, investigator.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Vale scowled. \"\"A mystery, Zaraki. Haven't you heard? Investigator Vale "
"solves mysteries. But I'll deal with that later. Right now, I think we could "
"both use a drink. Shall we go and inform the captain that he has a mess to "
"clean up below decks?\"\""

"By Bezumi, Khajiiti Ambassador to Summerset\n"
"\n"
"The High Elves are a particularly proud people, this we know. Their eyes "
"always seem to hold a look of disgust, as if we are a flea upon their bottom."
" Normally quick words and quicker claws answer such insults, but we have "
"come upon their land now. Walker, we are outnumbered and overpowered here "
"upon the shores of Summerset. It's time to adapt.\n"
"\n"
"A clever tongue will not do you as much good here as it did in our homeland. "
"These High Elves, well, they hold no laughter in their belly. They ignore "
"their guts and think only with their heads. Foolish, of course, but you can "
"no more change the mind of a High Elf than the turn of the tide. Let us then "
"be the cunning ones, as we always have.\n"
"\n"
"We shall start with history. A High Elf expects that a Khajiit know nothing, "
"and this one has found no greater delight than proving those jekosiits wrong."
" They will think us ignorant of even the most basic knowledge. We shall "
"disappoint them then, yes?\n"
"\n"
"The Thrassian Plague seems but a faded scar next to the still bleeding cut "
"of the Knahaten Flu, but it holds a deep importance to the mer of Summerset. "
"Bezumi thinks this has much to do with the involvement of their god-ancestor "
"Syrabane, also known as the Warlock's God. A mage so powerful that he "
"ascended into godhood, well, is that not the High Elf ideal?\n"
"\n"
"The Thrassian Plague was not a natural illness, but rather the work of a "
"vile race known as the Sload. Fat, slow, repugnant, the Sload worked dark "
"magic upon the sea to push this sickness upon much of Tamriel. It spread "
"quickly and fiercely, destroying towns, cities, entire civilizations. But as "
"with most great tragedies, heroes began to emerge. Syrabane is just the one "
"most honored by the High Elves.\n"
"\n"
"Though Syrabane was known to be an archmage of great power, he did not work "
"his magic alone, for he possessed a most powerful enchanted ring. With this, "
"he was able to save countless lives from the plague. Many say that it was he "
"alone who stopped this devastating illness from engulfing all of Tamriel. "
"Often Bezumi feels that the archmage is more revered for the power of such a "
"feat, rather than his compassion for those he saved, but she holds her "
"tongue with that one. \n"
"\n"
"Archmage Syrabane did not stop there, of course. He joined forces with the "
"Colovian King of Anvil, Baron-Admiral Bendu Olo, and went to stop the plague "
"at its source. Together they banded together the All Flags Navy, composed of "
"ships filled with not only mer but also Colovians, Redguards, Bretons, and "
"even Argonians. These races put aside their differences and sacrificed many "
"in their assault of Thras, the homeland of the Sload. And amazingly, despite "
"heavy losses, they won. They sank the Coral Kingdoms, and put the Sload into "
"their rightful place deep beneath the waves.\n"
"\n"
"I find this story particularly useful for a few reasons. I have mentioned "
"before, we must put a swift end to the misconception that we Khajiit are a "
"race ignorant of our allies. Indeed, I hope to publish several more journals "
"on the history and culture of the High Elves. But that is not the only "
"reason. Bezumi chose to start her collection with this particular history "
"because it shows the importance of allies. Of us.\n"
"\n"
"Without the military might each race brought to that battle, the victory of "
"the All Flags Navy would have been impossible. Yes, Syrabane was a powerful "
"mage with a useful ring, but he could not have won that fight alone. He had "
"to rely on many others to accomplish such a victory.\n"
"\n"
"When a High Elf turns up his nose as you start to speak? When a mother pulls "
"her child close as you walk by? Remember what Bezumi has told you, walker. "
"Remind them that this is not the first time that the all-mighty Summerset "
"was in need of friends. Remind them that they need us, just as much as we "
"need them."

"I seldom speak of my time on the Psijic Isle of Artaeum. My age and "
"temperament make such recollections irksome and discouraging—bad for the "
"digestion, as the clinicians say. Nonetheless, I owe it to my students to "
"give them some sense of where our Guild came from.\n"
"\n"
"Those who know me well know that I was not born on Artaeum. No, I grew up in "
"squalor—laboring under a bilious kinlord on the Isle of Summerset. It did "
"not last. Circumstances forced me to leave that life behind, and the Psijics "
"discovered my talents shortly thereafter. They told me that my old life was "
"over. No more hiding tomes under floorboards for fear of being discovered. "
"No more hay-raking and knee-bruising scullery work. I would live a sage's "
"life—free to study as I please, so long as those studies advanced the cause "
"of equity, peace, and wisdom. I felt such a great swell of joy in that "
"moment. Of course, no joy lasts forever.\n"
"\n"
"I told my guide, the mystic Heliand, I was eager to set sail as I had never "
"been on a seafaring vessel before. She laughed and threw down a glowing "
"rune, catapulting us through the Aurbis at speeds I'd never imagined "
"possible. Just seconds later, we found ourselves standing on a windswept "
"hill overlooking the idyllic fields and pastures of Artaeum.\n"
"\n"
"Each day brought new discoveries. Misty hollows, filled with gregarious "
"nixads. Hidden lagoons with singing waters, clear as fresh-blown glass. "
"Flowers that whispered secrets when the wind blew, and stones with names too "
"long for mortal tongues to speak. I read vigorously, wandered constantly, "
"and quickly earned my gray cloak.\n"
"\n"
"It was around this time that I first met Mannimarco—who would one day be "
"called the Worm King. In those days he was a brilliant novice with a "
"promising future, much like me. Our vast talents and contradictory natures "
"made us natural rivals. But then, the Old Ways of the Psijics banned such "
"competition. My mentor, the powerful Ritemaster Iachesis, told me, "
"\"\"Rivalry sows the seeds of war.\"\" Alas, he learned that blind amity can "
"have the same result.\n"
"\n"
"As I progressed in my studies I began to notice cracks in the Psijic code, "
"chief among them being the order's all-consuming passivity. Like a bemused "
"turtle, it lumbered along quietly—only occasionally poking its head above "
"the grass to check for danger. Iachesis began to look inward, and our "
"detachment from the affairs of Tamriel seemed to grow with each passing year."
" I still don't know why the Ritemaster began this march toward isolation, "
"but our emissaries and advisors started returning one by one. The mist "
"around the island grew thicker, and the petitions of kings came less "
"frequently. We suffered from an overabundance of caution when it came to "
"matters beyond the shores of Artaeum. This caution came at a high price.\n"
"\n"
"One brisk Frostfall evening, I found myself wandering amidst the ancient "
"stones of the Ceporah Tower. In that place, time itself feels sealed in "
"amber. Stiff wind whistles through the timeworn masonry, and the dull hum of "
"the Dreaming Cave can be felt through the soles of your boots. It is a place "
"of power, where law and reason give way to the sublime mysteries of creation."
" It was there, hidden within its torch-lit halls, that I found Mannimarco "
"channeling the powers of darkness. He had taken up the profane practice of "
"necromancy in secret and urged me to join him. I refused and prepared to "
"sunder his rituals with spells of banishing. Just as I began to weave my "
"spell, the tower lurched around us—the drone of the Dreaming Cave grew "
"urgent and bitter. Feeling the Island's anger all around us, we resolved to "
"settle our dispute with the Ritemaster the next morning.\n"
"\n"
"Standing before Iachesis, Mannimarco made an impassioned plea to permit the "
"study of necromancy. When Iachesis refused, Mannimarco grew belligerent and "
"vile. He spat curses and ancient blasphemies like a Daedric beast. I stood "
"by, all the while convinced that the Ritemaster would lock Mannimarco away. "
"But Iachesis did not lock him away. He scolded him, stripped him of his gray "
"robes, and banished him from the island.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You would unleash this broken Mer upon the people of Tamriel?\"\" I "
"shouted.\n"
"\n"
"Iachesis said nothing. He merely lifted his hand and showered Mannimarco in "
"radiant purple light. Then, just like that, my rival was gone. I stood "
"there, aghast. The Mer I most admired had thrown open the gates of a wolf's "
"cage and set the beast loose on a world of gentle sheep. Now, in the wake of "
"the Planemeld, we see the grim result of Iachesis's mercy.\n"
"\n"
"I left Artaeum shortly thereafter. I remember looking over my shoulder and "
"seeing its great cliffs and rolling pastures recede into the fog. I learned "
"later that the island vanished just hours after I departed. It's difficult "
"to see that as coincidence. Perhaps Iachesis recognized his folly and went "
"into seclusion. Perhaps the Psijics knew what Mannimarco would unleash and "
"chose safety over struggle. Whatever the case, the isle of the Psijics "
"passed into memory and the once-proud order sank into obscurity.\n"
"\n"
"When they return, if they return, I hope they remember their oath to guide "
"Tamriel toward peace and prosperity. In the meantime, we mages of the Guild "
"must take up their mantle. Protect the helpless, seek out new spells and new "
"discoveries, and above all, be brave. In the face of arcane peril, the Mages "
"Guild must lead the way."

"By Lailfin, Steward of Histories at the Illumination Academy\n"
"\n"
"The true work of any historian lies in separating fact from fiction—studying "
"the diverse and contradictory texts of all races and piecing together a "
"plausible shared narrative. This requires diligence, discipline, and most "
"importantly, humility. The true historian must be willing to admit error and "
"revise their accounts when new evidence comes to light.\n"
"\n"
"One of the most pernicious traps for new historians is reliance on "
"supporting accounts—that is, the belief that if multiple writers detail the "
"same event in the same way, those accounts are more likely to be true. In "
"point of fact, we should assume the opposite. Societal pressures and "
"widespread cultural delusions often result in identical historical accounts. "
"For example, Nedic texts often reference an event called the \"\"Autumn of "
"Snakes.\"\" According to the histories, hundreds of snakes (many the size of "
"mammoths) emerged from the ground and devoured whole towns before finally "
"being subdued by the Nede spear-maiden, Ranev the Coal-Eyed Wanderer. Nedic "
"scholars describe the Autumn in meticulous and near-identical detail, and "
"yet, we now know that the event is completely apocryphal.\n"
"\n"
"It's not that the writers are deliberately lying (though that is sometimes "
"the case). In all likelihood, ancient historians were trying their best to "
"describe events faithfully. Unfortunately, they did not have the linguistic "
"tools or scholarly sophistication to give a truthful account. For that "
"reason, we must take a long hard look at any tales that are widely accepted, "
"but also seem hyperbolic. We must also look for \"\"recurring "
"calamities\"\"—that is, events that purportedly happened the same way, but "
"in vastly different locales and time periods.\n"
"\n"
"The most obvious example of the \"\"recurring calamity\"\" is the tale of "
"the disappearing island. Tamrielic history is littered with sinking, hidden, "
"or disappearing islands. Yokuda, Pyandonea, Artaeum, Dranil Kir, Eyevea, "
"Thras, and (perhaps most importantly) Aldmeris. The cause of the "
"disappearance is almost always magical in nature—often the result of some "
"act of hubris or a desire for secrecy. Of course, this all begs the question:"
" are any of these tales true? I have my doubts.\n"
"\n"
"Let us examine the mythical \"\"sinking\"\" islands: Yokuda, Thras, and "
"Aldmeris. Each island was the ancestral home of its resident race, and in "
"all three cases, foes or fate destroyed the island as punishment for some "
"act of hubris. In the case of the Redguards, foolish sword-singers sundered "
"the Yokudan Isles with a forbidden sword stroke. The warriors of the All-"
"Flags Navy drove the Sload and their island of Thras into the sea as "
"punishment for the Thrassian Plague. And our forebears, the Aldmer, fled the "
"Isle of Aldmeris to avoid some mysterious calamity—likely the result of our "
"fall from Aedric grace.\n"
"\n"
"Now, a novice historian would likely take these tales at face value. \"\"If "
"multiple histories say the island sank, it must have sunk!\"\" But I entreat "
"you to look deeper. Could it be that the \"\"sinking island\"\" is not a "
"literal event, but rather, a metaphorical one? \n"
"\n"
"Thras, Yokuda, and Aldmeris are much more than simple landmasses; they are "
"societal symbols—avatars for a cultural identity lost in time. So stories "
"about the sundering or sinking of these islands may be a trick of the "
"light—a poet's attempt at explaining the pain of forgotten origins. Did an "
"entire continent drown as a result of a sword stroke? Did our ancestors "
"travel to Summerset from a mystical half-Aedric isle? I think not. These "
"lost islands rest at the fault-line between fact and parable. There is truth "
"in those tales, certainly, but the true historian knows that not all truth "
"is literal."

"By Kinlady Avinisse of Shimmerene\n"
"\n"
"The Unforeseen Queen continues to impose her radical ideas upon her loyal "
"subjects, inflicting all manner of change and sorrow upon this pristine and "
"uncompromising land. Her attempts to elevate the other races and put them on "
"equal footing with the Altmer is simply unnatural. Everyone knows the value "
"of High Elven supremacy, so why try to weaken it with these impure and "
"totally unwarranted decrees? Let it be known that the people of Shimmerene "
"and their Kinlady shall endeavor to do everything in our power to oppose "
"this unreasonable and ultimately dangerous decree.\n"
"\n"
"Why do I reject an end to the pristine nature of Summerset? Why, because of "
"logic, of course! It is a well-documented fact that the Altmer are superior "
"in every way to the lesser races that share our world. After all, who else "
"can trace their lineage directly to the Aedra? We proudly proclaim our "
"divine heritage. Unlike the other races, we are not the creations of the "
"gods; we are their descendants. Our genetic lineage can be traced to the "
"original Aldmer race, through the Ehlnofey to the divine et'Ada themselves. "
"For this reason and this reason alone, we should be permitted to preserve "
"our pure bloodlines and maintain the sanctity of our perfect island home.\n"
"\n"
"Should the Adventurous Queen desire more proof, we need only look to our "
"stature, our golden hue, and our natural inclination toward magic. The other "
"races cannot compete with us in intellectual pursuits. They just aren't "
"equipped for such a battle. Ours is the first true culture of Tamriel and we "
"remained the most civilized of all the races. This fact cannot be refuted. "
"We provided the basis for religion, language, and even architecture, and our "
"influence can be seen across the continent. For all that we have provided, "
"we should be allowed to keep a small piece of the world as solely our own.\n"
"\n"
"Beyond these self-evident truths, we must consider the poor lesser races as "
"well. How cruel it will be to subject them to the rigors and requirements of "
"our exacting culture and societal mores. They simply aren't equipped to "
"handle the precision our customs and traditions demand. Should we embarrass "
"them for these failings? Or worse yet, should we amplify their deficiencies "
"by setting a lesser standard for them to adhere to? They would call us "
"cruel, and rightly so. Let us keep the metaphorical gates closed, and then "
"neither side will suffer any sorrow or discomfort. Allowing the lesser races "
"to migrate to Summerset doesn't do them any favors. Quite the opposite, it "
"will ultimately hurt them in the end.\n"
"\n"
"Keep Summerset pure. Keep Summerset pristine. Keep Summerset for the Altmer. "
"Anything else makes no sense whatsoever."

"There is a divide between the realms of Boethiah and Clavicus Vile where "
"need and hunger are one. A thin, vestigial place clinging to the skin of "
"Mundus, gnawing in futility to break through. This is the Gorge. A pit of "
"famine and desperation where brutal Daedra spend eternity devouring anything "

"\n"
"Pinnacle among these wretched creatures is the Insatiable, a hunger of great "

"between the Gorge and Nirn and ambush its next meal.\n"

"By Royal Decree of the Ceremoniarchy of Queen Ayrenn Arana Aldmeri, Monarch "

"By Kinlord Andurion\n"
"\n"
"My fellow citizens, I was as worried as you were when I read Queen Ayrenn's "
"proclamation. Opening up our borders was not a decision to take lightly. I "
"too feared the dire implications such an act would have on our beloved "
"homeland. Would our cities be infested with fleas? Would our children be "
"stolen from their beds at night? Fellow citizens, I assure you, I had just "
"as many concerns about the safety of our proud Summerset as you.\n"
"\n"
"As a Kinlord, I had the great privilege of voicing these concerns to the "
"very court of Summerset, and often found myself in the middle of the hotly "
"debated topic. It was unprecedented, madness of the wildest kind! I was "
"determined to put a stop to the desecration of our beloved homeland. I too "
"felt as though we were betraying our ancestor's wishes. Yes, my fellow "
"citizens, I did adamantly oppose the very idea of opening our borders to "
"these outsiders, cats and cannibals that I knew to be unworthy.\n"
"\n"
"Then something changed. I changed. Please, allow me to tell you why I now "
"wholeheartedly support the queen's decree. Allow me to plead the rights of "
"those who are now our allies and neighbors.\n"
"\n"
"This change started with the stories I heard of the war effort, of that I am "
"certain. A narrow victory, only assured by the archery support provided by "
"the Wood Elves. Khajiit agents who learned decisive secrets through clever "
"subterfuge. Even looking at simply the numbers of our forces, no matter our "
"military expertise and strength, I knew it was impossible to fight this war "
"alone. Still, I was adamant. Our tentative associates need only serve us on "
"the front line. What need had we for them here in Summerset?\n"
"\n"
"I was set in my ways, and I felt that nothing could sway me. It was only "
"when the unimaginable happened that I saw the truth. \n"
"\n"
"Andimeril, my shining star and only son, fell upon the battlefield. How "
"often I think back to the night he left. If only perhaps I had been less "
"stubborn. If only I hadn't bitten my tongue out of spite. If only I could "
"have found the right words to convince him to stay. He was young and "
"foolhardy, and far braver than I have ever been. The very thought that I'll "
"never see his face again still tightens my chest so painfully I can barely "
"breath.\n"
"\n"
"I did not learn of my son's death through courier or friend. No, I found out "
"when a young Wood Elf stood before me, boots caked in mud and eyes filled "
"with tears. In her hands was a plain, metal box, and I knew before she even "
"spoke that my son's ashes were inside it. Her name was Grenith.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"He never asked me to do this,\"\" she said as her tears began to fall. "
"\"\"In fact, he always said he was never coming back. But I just couldn't "
"bear the thought, you know? He deserved to come home.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Before that day I had never even spoken to a member of another race, never "
"looked into the eyes of those who I had always believed were so much lower "
"than myself. It was then that I could no longer deny what was happening. "
"That day my eyes were finally opened to the truth, not through debate or "
"decree, but simply from that shared sorrow I felt with Grenith. So painful "
"it had to be real.\n"
"\n"
"The allies who we think so little of are dying with our sons and daughters, "
"every day. They share meals, exchange stories, try to find laughter and "
"comfort when they can. They fight side-by-side, entrusting each other with "
"their lives. This is the reality of their daily battle, far from our "
"tranquil shores.\n"
"\n"
"Grenith told me about the last weeks of Andimeril's life. Perhaps it was "
"only to comfort a grieving old mer, but she had nothing but admiration for "
"my son. Her words of his bravery and kindness gave me a solemn comfort. My "
"son died standing up for the ideals he believed in. To me, a letter from our "
"queen herself would not have honored Andimeril more than the kind words of "
"his fellow soldier.\n"
"\n"
"How selfish the thought is even now, but this comfort would not have been "
"possible without our open borders. The honor that Grenith showed to my "
"family would never have happened. She would have been treated just as I "
"always believed her kind should be treated, as inferior, as unworthy. "
"Without her,  Andimeril would never have found his way back home, but rather "
"remained as an unknown corpse on some distant battlefield. I would never "
"have gotten the honor of putting my son to rest.\n"
"\n"
"My fellow citizens, these other races deserve nothing but our respect. If my "
"personal story in no way moves you, please, I implore you to speak to them. "
"Buy them a drink at your local tavern, invite them into your home for a meal."
" As a culture of scholars, we must open our minds and learn. Do so and I "
"assure you, you'll find cultures that are vastly different, often shockingly "
"so, but just as rich as our own.\n"
"\n"
"Don't close your minds as we once sealed our borders. Our future depends on "
"the ability to move forward. Take that first step with me, my fellow "
"citizens. Soon you'll find yourself walking toward tomorrow."

"Narrator: Once in the heart of Alinor there lived a young mer by the name of "
"Virenire. Though she was quite a beauty and admired by many, her family had "
"always been poor. And so she worked as a serving maid.\n"
"\n"
"Virenire: Dearest me, how I long to be out of these rags.\n"
"\n"
"Narrator: Virenire cleaned diligently and was often praised by her mistress "
"Teryldil, but still she dreamed of a grand life full of wonder. When she "
"heard of a coming ball in the Royal Palace, she knew she had to attend.\n"
"\n"
"Virenire: Oh, a royal ball! I just know the prince will be there! But how "
"can I go in such a dress?\n"
"\n"
"Narrator: Virenire was determined. She saved and pleaded and begged, and "
"finally was able to afford a beautiful dress. She even convinced her wealthy "
"mistress to bring her along as an attendant.\n"
"\n"
"Teryldil: Oh, you've been so diligent for so long. How could I possibly say "
"no?\n"
"\n"
"Narrator: But still, Teryldil was a smart mistress, and gave her servant a "
"warning.\n"
"\n"
"Teryldil: Now, you may come to this ball, but always remember your place "
"Verenire. No matter how beautiful you are or how well you dress, you shall "
"always be a servant.\n"
"\n"
"Narrator: This made Virenire very sad, for she had hoped to catch the eye of "
"a wealthy noble. But still she stayed silent, as a good servant should. The "
"very next night mistress and servant attended the ball.\n"
"\n"
"Virenire: What wondrous clothes! What delicious food! Why, if only every day "
"was filled with such elegance, I shall be the happiest mer is Summerset.\n"
"\n"
"Narrator: So great was Virenire's beauty, she caught the eye of the young "
"prince. Forgetting all decorum, he went over to her and asked for a dance. "
"And so the prince and the servant girl danced for a good portion of the "
"night.\n"
"\n"
"Prince: I've never seen such a beautiful mer. Tell me, who are your parents?\n"
"\n"
"Virenire: Oh, dear prince, I feel I must be honest. My parents are poor "
"peasants, and I but a serving girl to a wealthy mistress.\n"
"\n"
"Narrator: Gazing upon the beautiful eyes of such an entrancing mer, the good "
"Prince came to a startling realization.\n"
"\n"
"Prince: Why, I've been tricked! Here I thought you were a noble mer of good "
"standing, who I might court and one day wed. But you are a mere servant girl."
"\n"
"\n"
"Narrator: And though the words stung her heart, Virenire knew them to be "
"true. For only a noble mer would be able to marry someone such as a prince. "
"So Virenire resolved to find herself a suitable husband within her caste. "
"The prince, of course, married a Kinlady of suitable reputation and never "
"spoke to the servant girl again. And so we should all remember, no matter "
"our looks or possessions, we shall always be beholden to our family's name."

"By Quill, House of Reveries Archivist\n"
"\n"
"So you've joined us for a life of reveries, of intrigue and drama and joy! "
"I'm so proud of you, dear heart, so very proud. Let me be the first among us "
"to welcome you home.\n"
"\n"
"Now begins your transformation. Yes, you've chosen a name and donned a new "
"mask, but that's only the beginning. Learn to change your voice, adopt new "
"mannerisms, dye your hair bright colors. Learn to tell a thousand boasts but "
"never a hint of the truth. You'll be tested, again and again. After all, "
"there's no greater romance than the allure of intrigue. Stay strong and stay "
"silent. Your very place within our troupe hinges upon your discretion. \n"
"\n"
"There's more to learn, dear heart. So you've mastered the gentle plucks of "
"the lute? Pick up a sword and learn theatrical fencing! The best and "
"brightest performers that Summerset has to offer now surround you. Don't "
"waste this opportunity trying to protect your silly pride. Fall flat on your "
"face, warble out a shaky note, and never stop growing. Every new skill you "
"learn strengthens the entirety of our troupe. There's no such thing as a "
"perfect performance, but we all damn well try our best to get there.\n"
"\n"
"Though Rellenthil may be our base of operations, the Manor of Masques cannot "
"hold every member of our dear troupe. Besides, Summerset is a large island. "
"How can we expect every adored member of our audience to make the trek to "
"us? No, you'll be expected to live most of your days on the open road, "
"lending a helping hand as needed. We fully expect every member to pull their "
"own weight. You'll brush down the horses, oil creaky wagon wheels, cook "
"supper, and dig out latrines. And remember, complaining will only earn you "
"naught but more chores for your trouble.\n"
"\n"
"Every traveling troupe is led by a Maestro, a senior member who has proven "
"worthy of such a majestic title. It wasn't too long ago that I was making my "
"first trip around Summerset with my Maestro, a rather taciturn mer that went "
"by the name of Baritone. It seemed we were doomed to dislike each other from "
"our first meeting, for I thought myself silver-tongued and quick-footed. "
"Maestro Baritone instantly saw through my act and gave me the longest, "
"driest, and most monotone monologue I had ever read to memorize for my first "
"performance.\n"
"\n"
"I nearly cried when I read it, for I thought it nothing short of sabotage. I "
"would toss and turn at night, imagining the disapproving faces of my "
"audience. Daily I begged Maestro Baritone to give me another part, but to no "
"prevail. He simply shook his head and told me to get back to it. "
"Painstakingly, I memorized every line of that cursed monologue, every dry "
"and boring second of it. It was only when I memorized it without fail, "
"without hesitation, that Maestro Baritone gave my next direction.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Now, Quill,\"\" he told me with one of his rare smiles, \"\"I want you "
"to make it your own.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I was stunned. Despite my hatred for the accursed monologue, I found myself "
"arguing. This was a piece of history! Written by our ancestors of old, "
"renowned enough to survive through the centuries. How could I change it? "
"Defile it? I felt no end of bafflement, as the Maestro had always been an "
"absolute stickler for rules and regulations.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You've honored this piece already,\"\" he told me. \"\"You've read it "
"again and again. You know every name, every place, every detail, but you "
"also know it has no heart. I believe in you, Quill. You're the one to give "
"it that heart.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I was transformed that day. The name I seemed to so casually bequeath upon "
"myself truly became who I was. I was a quill, ready to create, eager to "
"write the words again. Anew. Even to this day I find no greater pleasure "
"than breathing life into a stagnant work of old. And my Maestro, the mer who "
"I so adamantly disliked upon our very first meeting, was the one who showed "
"me that. Never would I have guessed such a thing, that first teary night.\n"
"\n"
"Learn. Listen. Create. You've said but your first line, sung but your first "
"note. You have such a long, difficult, tiring, wondrous journey before you, "
"dear heart. Love every minute of that great production. The curtains open, "
"you step upon the stage. We all simply cannot wait to see your performance."

"\n"
"So you wish to join in our reveries, my dear heart? I'm afraid it's not "
"quite as simple as possessing a mere resolve and paying some modest dues. "
"No, we have quite the indoctrination process. But you've memorized your "
"lines and sang your parts, haven't you? You've honed your skill, whether it "
"be the daring talent of swallowing swords or the intricate movements of "
"dance. And so it is time for the audition.\n"
"\n"
"We announce open auditions every season, which last for a scant few weeks. "
"You simply need to find the courage to hop up on stage and impress us with "
"your talent! One of the players of our troupe will speak to you after your "
"dazzling performance and tell you if you're worthy to become one of our "
"Hopefuls. If not, better luck next season!\n"
"\n"
"Now, let's not confuse a Hopeful for anything more than what it is. As a "
"Hopeful, you're permitted to enter our Manor of Masques in order to hone "
"your craft and learn from the best. We shall even present you with a mask of "
"your very own, as well as a new name. But you haven't joined the House of "
"Reveries just yet, dear heart. No, this is only the first step of your path. "
"For all Hopefuls must pass the final audition.\n"
"\n"
"Though this may be a harrowing journey, you'll not travel it alone. A mentor "
"guides all Hopefuls, a senior member of the troupe who helps prepare you for "
"that oh-so-important final audition. This mentor serves as as a fountain  of "
"wisdom from which you may drink. Take their words to heart and follow their "
"example. Your mentor is key to entering into our troupe. It's not merely "
"enough to learn the steps and memorize the words. Within you must burn the "
"passion of a true artist. Your mentor can kindle the flame, but it's up to "
"you to stoke it into the raging fire it must become.\n"
"\n"
"Your fellow Hopefuls will be your steadfast companions during this time, and "
"you are fully encouraged to befriend them! After all, these may soon be your "
"fellow players. Let not fear or jealousy sink you to bitterness, for you do "
"not compete for a single spot. There have been seasons where every Hopeful "
"was invited join, and there have been seasons where all were rejected. But "
"you will have to rely on your own talent during the final audition. Depend "
"not on the mistakes of others, but be wary of your own.\n"
"\n"
"Though I tell you to befriend your fellow Hopefuls, always remember that "
"your identity is no longer your own. You are expected to wear your mask at "
"all times and never speak your old name. This is the beginning of your "
"training, after all. You must act as a current member of our troupe, and "
"that means beginning your life of privacy and intrigue. Your old name should "
"only be known to yourself, your mentor, and the Grand Maestro. And then it "
"should be forgotten.\n"
"\n"
"The final audition comes upon you quicker than you can imagine. Here, you "
"stand before the Grand Maestro, the ring leader of our merry circus, the "
"conductor of our great symphony, the director of this play of reveries. The "
"Grand Maestro shall decide your ultimate fate. \n"
"\n"
"Your final performance must be the greatest show of renown, of desire, of "
"expertise that you have ever demonstrated. Everything, your entire being, "
"must fill this performance. And that is when we'll know if you're ready, "
"dear heart. That is when we'll finally know if you're willing to cast aside "
"everything—your name, your family, your entire life—and join us as a member "
"of the House of Reveries."

"A Primer for Hopeful Recruits\n"
"By Quill, House of Reveries Archivist\n"
"\n"
"Welcome, dear heart, to the House of Reveries, home of the greatest players "
"in Summerset! Perhaps aspirations of fame brought you here, or dreams of "
"fortune. Perhaps mere curiosity or a need to belong. Nonetheless, before you "
"undergo the extensive audition process to join our grand troupe, you must "
"understand our order. And like all great plays, the best place to start is "
"always at the beginning. \n"
"\n"
"A High Elf of noble intentions, and more than likely noble heritage, founded "
"the House of Reveries. Grand Maestro Ingress was a leader of extraordinary "
"vision and significant wealth, and it's she that sets the prelude to our "
"great story. Though there are many plays, poems, and songs dedicated to her "
"honor, all tell the same tale of her dedication and passion to the art of "
"performance. But rather than stemming from a need to create something new, "
"our first Grand Maestro's dedication grew from a distaste of the old.\n"
"\n"
"Before she was ever a Grand Maestro, our founder was but a simple mer of "
"great passion. Many say her father nurtured her ever-growing love for "
"performance. She appreciated all forms of the beloved art, whether it was "
"the drama of a great monologue of old or the merriment of a simple juggling "
"act. Yes, she felt kinship toward all of her fellow performers, from the "
"humblest backgrounds to the greatest of names. And for a time she was happy.\n"
"\n"
"Alas, she grew older, and with age came a dark wisdom. She gazed into the "
"heart of her fellow performers and found few who held true love for their "
"craft. She began to realize that these mer saw the arts as a  stepping-"
"stone, a path that would eventually lead to notoriety and power. A way to "
"elevate their names to the highest rank, to become privileged and renowned. "
"The poor soul grew more isolated as she encountered fewer kindred souls and "
"soon withdrew from the world of performance, though it pained her greatly to "
"do so.\n"
"\n"
"It was during this time of isolation that she reflected on what she could do "
"to change this troubling trend. Determined to make a difference, she did the "
"unthinkable. She cast aside her own name, burning down her old identity. "
"From those ashes she rose as the Grand Maestro Ingress, and swore to create "
"a group of like-minded companions. And thus the House of Reveries was born.\n"
"\n"
"All members of our troupe would live for their passion and their passion "
"alone. To keep this manifesto in mind, Grand Maestro Ingress declared that "
"all her players would wear masks and take up new names. They would never "
"reveal their original identities, for it was the prominence of names that "
"had turned so many of her fellow performers bitter and joyless. All who "
"joined the House of Reveries would do so only for the love of the craft, the "
"thrill of the performance. The only thing her players would crave was the "
"resounding applause of the crowd.\n"
"\n"
"And so we come to you, dear heart, to determine what you wish to be. Who you "
"wish to be. Have you come upon our doorsteps hoping for mere fame and "
"fortune, or are you ready to cast off such selfish chains and live for the "
"art? If you wish to join us, know that you shall never be you again. You'll "
"be something brighter, something beautiful. You'll gain a thousand faces, "
"but shall never show your own.\n"
"\n"
"Will you wear the mask?"

"By Axulfa Giant-Slayer, Nord Cultural Exchange\n"
"\n"
"I have traveled far and wide as a member of the Nord Cultural Exchange. I "
"visited all of the lands associated with my beloved Ebonheart Pact, "
"including Morrowind and Black Marsh. I explored Wrothgar, the land of the "
"Orcs. But the place that has made my head hurt most of all is the island of "
"the snooty High Elves, Summerset. Even Rigurt dislikes the smug, pointy-"
"eared milk-drinkers, and he likes everybody! Kyne knows I endeavor to be "
"nice and struggle not to hit a few of them with my axe, no matter how much "
"they test my patience.\n"
"\n"
"My first task upon arriving in this land that smells of salt water and "
"pretension was to gather whatever information I could concerning law and "
"order. Even though we arrived under a banner of peace and diplomacy, we are "
"still Nords. While I can't determine if the High Elves dislike us because of "
"our association with the Pact or because we don't look like they do, I must "
"make sure that the members of our delegation don't inadvertently break a "
"rule and cause an international incident. The island has more than its share "
"of guards and town constables, but the real power seems to lie in the oddly "
"named Divine Prosecution.\n"
"\n"
"The Divine Prosecution consists of duly authorized agents loyal to Queen "
"Ayrenn and her Thalmor, the paramilitary enforcers of the Dominion. On "
"Summerset, the Divine Prosecution represents law and order, responsible for "
"enforcing both secular and religious law. They seem to be similar to the "
"Ordinators of the Tribunal, but without all the creepy face masks and fancy "
"armor. I was able to interview one of their number, a somber but otherwise "
"accommodating justiciar named Rullion. \n"
"\n"
"Justiciar Rullion explained that the primary function of the Divine "
"Prosecution was to act as investigators of crimes and minor offenses, and "
"adjudicators of disputes and legal disagreements. I got the sense that they "
"had a much broader mandate than he let on, serving as not only secular "
"lawkeepers but as the protectors of religious and social mores. When I "
"pressed, he admitted that he and his fellow justiciars were called in when "
"situations developed beyond the skills of the local constabulary. \"\"We go "
"where our investigations take us,\"\" he added before leaving me to my mid-"
"day meal of rabbit meatballs and a few bottles of mead.\n"
"\n"
"As I wandered around the city of Alinor I noticed that Rullion seemed to be "
"going about the business of the Divine Prosecution while remaining always in "
"my field of vision. I watched him settle an argument between a merchant and "
"her customer, hearing both sides before rendering a binding decision that "
"each accepted before he moved on. Then he apprehended a pickpocket in the "
"act of stealing a noble's purse and handed the criminal to one of the city "
"guards. Through it all, I had the feeling that all the while he was actually "
"keeping an eye on me. I suppose observing foreign visitors also falls under "
"the purview of the agents of the Divine Prosecution. I didn't really mind. "
"Besides, his constant presence would make it easier to find him at supper "
"time.\n"
"\n"
"I wonder if Justiciar Rullion has a taste for mead?"

"By Nularan, Mages Guild Scribe\n"
"\n"
"Some call them wise and learned. Others consider them to be the finest "
"magical minds in the Summerset Isles (though many of my brethren would "
"contest that statement). They are the Sapiarchs, the sages of the Crystal "
"Tower and the instructors of the heirs to the royal throne of Summerset. A "
"few of the greatest mages of the age can be counted among their numbers, but "
"in general they are scholars of magical and esoteric knowledge, each devoted "
"to a specific and singular topic of study.\n"
"\n"
"The Sapiarchs serve as the keepers of the Crystal Tower, also called the "
"Lawful Crystal and the Crystal-Like-Law. The tower is so named not because "
"it is constructed of crystal, but because it houses Transparent Law, a "
"magical crystal that rests at the top of the tower.\n"
"\n"
"A handful of sages live within the tower, tending to its needs and guarding "
"its secrets, while others come and go as their studies dictate. Of course, "
"getting into the tower isn't as simple as walking up and opening the door. "
"The way is hidden and guarded by powerful wards, and the only method for "
"gaining entrance requires the assistance of the Tower Sentinels. This pair "
"of specially attuned Sapiarchs each bear an object needed to access the "
"tower—one of two Resolute Diamonds. When properly attuned and used "
"simultaneously by the Tower Sentinels, the azure diamonds open the path into "
"the Crystal Tower. Only two such Sentinels are ever activated, for each must "
"undergo a long and extensive ritual to link them to the diamonds they bear. "
"Sentinels keep their charge for eleven years before a new pair take up "
"guardianship of the diamonds.\n"
"\n"
"The rest of the sagely order is organized into the College of Sapiarchs, "
"with each member dedicated to and responsible for a specific field of "
"magical or esoteric scholarship. Larnatille of Lillandril, Sapiarch of "
"Arcanology, leads the college, which consists of two-hundred-and-twenty-"
"three distinct disciplines assigned to a Sapiarch and his or her assistant. "
"Spread throughout Summerset, the Sapiarchs work individually or in small "
"groups on independent studies or to research specific topics for the college "
"as a whole. Some research can be conducted at the Crystal Tower or at the "
"College of Sapiarchs in Lillandril, but otherwise the sages travel the lands "
"as necessary or lock themselves in their own libraries to ponder the "
"complexities of the world's greatest mysteries.\n"
"\n"
"As the interpreters of the Scrolls of Praxis, the precedents by which the "
"rulers of the Summerset Isles govern their domain, the Sapiarchs play a "
"vital role in the maintenance of the Ceremoniarchy. Indeed, the Scrolls of "
"Praxis are said to have foretold that Princess Ayrenn would reflect the "
"restless and turbulent times she was born into and would eventually rule "
"over. When the time is right, heirs to the throne come to the Sapiarchs to "
"study Altmeri Regal Praxis and Ceremoniarchy for a requisite 3,555 days "
"prior to receiving the crown. Afterward, the College of Sapiarchs serves as "
"a powerful resource for the new ruler, offering advice and counsel when "
"called upon.\n"
"\n"
"For all their professed learning and scholarly pursuits, the Sapiarchs seem "
"overly interested in signs and portents. They attribute deep and significant "
"meaning to the movements of the constellations, the positions of the moons, "
"the disposition of animals, and even the swirls of foam atop a bowl of "
"century soup. This tug of war between intellectualism and superstition may "
"seem like a contradiction to you and me, but the Sapiarchs see them as two "
"sides of the same coin. And, as with a coin, you need both sides to pay the "
"cost of admission, or so the Sapiarchs say.\n"
"\n"
"Some of the leading Sapiarch fields of study include Oblivion Studies, "
"Indoctrination, Altmeri Heritage, Enchantment, Mythohistory, Daedric "
"Fallacies, Selenology, and Divine Orthodoxy. To indicate their office and "
"field of study, each carries a title such as Sapiarch of Altmeri Arts or "
"Assistant Sapiarch of Naval Excogitation. A Sapiarch holds the title for "
"life or until he or she petitions to change their area of scholarship. The "
"Tower Sentinels, however, carry out their responsibilities regarding the "
"Resolute Diamonds for a period of eleven years before passing the tower keys "
"to the next Sapiarchs in line and returning to concentrate on their "
"particular fields of study."

"Entry 1\n"
"\n"
"At long last, my dear friend Norasea arrived in Lillandril. Emile and I "
"spirited her away at once. I hastily assembled a lab in the bowels of "
"Saltbreeze Cave—away from prying eyes. I fear that if my fellow Sapiarchs "
"see her condition, they will simply quarantine her until it's too late.\n"
"\n"
"She brought a friend with her—a wiry Elf named Gerwerdel. I fear that this "
"woman may be too far gone. She paces constantly—often muttering to herself. "
"Already, dark, rigid splotches appear on her chest and arms. I will try to "
"slow the disease's progress, but my first priority remains Norasea. She was "
"a friend to me when no one else was. Now I finally have the opportunity to "
"return that kindness. I hope we're not too late.\n"
"\n"
"Entry 2\n"
"\n"
"Emile and I brewed up a powerful antiseptic for Gerwerdel's stone-growths, "
"but it's a palliative measure at best. Her behavior grows more erratic with "
"each passing day. Despite Norasea's protests, we had to isolate her in one "
"of our restraining chambers.\n"
"\n"
"None of our curatives seem to have any effect on Norasea's symptoms. Emile "
"and I work in concert, day and night. Honestly, I don't know what I'd do "
"without Emile. It's only his love and attention that makes the long nights "
"and constant failures bearable.\n"
"\n"
"Entry 3\n"
"\n"
"I thought we had it. Emile and I combined Nirnroot condensate with a number "
"of lesser reagents to create a highly-focused stone-shaping elixir. We "
"thought that breaking up the keratous masses accumulating beneath the skin "
"might halt the disease's progression. Instead, we seem to have simply broken "
"the masses into smaller shards, encouraging a more rapid rate of spread. I'm "
"at wits end. We may be too late.\n"
"\n"
"Entry 4\n"
"\n"
"Emile has an idea. I hesitate to commit it to paper. Our tests on the "
"keratous growths indicated that they spread through vascular transmission. "
"The disease converts elements of the blood into rigid grains that accumulate "
"in the veins just beneath the skin, then calcify into larger and larger "
"growths. It's the blood. The sickness is in the blood.\n"
"\n"
"Once we arrived at that critical insight, Emile suggested he might have a "
"solution: Porphyric Hemophilia-better known as vampirism. I was aghast at "
"the idea. But I trust his models. Vampirism, as we understand it, "
"drastically alters blood composition. Theoretically, this reconfiguration "
"could make it impossible for the keratous growths to form. We wouldn't be "
"able to restore Norasea's eyesight, but we could very well halt the disease "
"in its tracks. I must think on this.\n"
"\n"
"Entry 5 \n"
"\n"
"After long consideration, I've decided to proceed with Emile's plan. I "
"appraised Norasea of the details, and she agreed to go through with it. Now "
"it's just a matter of reproducing the vampiric infection alchemically. The "
"Sapiarchs would never approve of such a gambit, but I promised Norasea we "
"would cure her. Sometimes tradition must make way for frightening innovation."
" \n"
"\n"
"Entry 6 \n"
"\n"
"We successfully completed the procedure. Norasea reacted predictably to the "
"introduction of the vampiric affliction. As far as we can tell, our "
"treatment was a success. We've seen no expansion of keratous growths, and "
"her mental faculties seem totally restored. I told Emile that we must "
"administer the treatment to Gerwerdel too. He seems very concerned about it, "
"but I can't deny such a treatment to someone just because they are dangerous."
" I will give her the injection tonight. Magnus help me."

"By Telenger the Artificer \n"
"\n"
"A most unexpected curiosity has entered my collection after being "
"appropriated from a defeated Maormeri fleet. Why this text was aboard one of "
"the vessels, I cannot guess, but it appears to be the journal of a diplomat "
"to Thras written before 1E 2260. Though it is damaged, the descriptions of "
"the Sload that remain legible are fascinating—assuming this is not some "
"strange work of fiction or forgery. If it is legitimate, it is a remarkable "
"find, as the Sload have always been loath to treat with any of the races of "
"Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"We know that the slug-folk of Thras practiced foul necromancy, but their "
"involvement with that dread art may have been more prominent than previously "
"thought, if this is an authentic text. The author expresses frequent disgust "
"at interacting with re-animated slaves. It seems the Sload also slaughtered "
"and revived various sea creatures—turtles, crabs, and the like—to keep as "
"pets. His repulsion did not end there, though, as he complained about the "
"repugnant smell of the Sload, the several inches of slime-coated water upon "
"the floors of any land-based building, and the various molds and fungi that "
"served as food.\n"
"\n"
"There are mentions of elaborate sacrificial rituals, which I find unusual "
"given their general rejection of worship. The Sload certainly entered pacts "
"with the Daedra when it suited them, but the ceremonies described here are "
"not indicative of typical Daedric sacrifice. They may have spent years "
"grooming individuals to participate in re-enactments of the deeds of Sload "
"mythological heroes and villains, with the eventual performance (which may "
"have lasted weeks) culminating in the deaths of every actor by the "
"application of \"\"desiccation crystals\"\" to the body. Ancestor worship? "
"Unnamed deities? Preservation of ancient magics? It is impossible to tell.\n"
"\n"
"More intriguing is a badly-damaged entry that discusses an audience in the "
"submerged tower of an \"\"Elder Distended One.\"\" I can make out little of "
"the discussion between the two, but there are mentions of an "
"\"\"impressively corpulent body and strangely pulsating head,\"\" and three "
"eyes that emerged upon its belly that each \"\"opened again as a toothless "
"mouth, disgorging [unreadable] that the attendants eagerly consumed.\"\" "
"This is the first insight I have encountered into potential cultural "
"leadership among the Sload.\n"
"\n"
"It has caused me no end of frustration that the entries chronicling a visit "
"to the \"\"Menagerie of Sublime Infection\"\" are nearly unreadable. Aside "
"from the name, almost nothing of this section can be deciphered aside from "
"several unnerving words implying all manner of affliction, from "
"\"\"suppurating extrusions\"\" and \"\"blood-rot\"\" to \"\"festering "
"myiasis.\"\" Much about the Thrassian Plague remains a mystery—and perhaps "
"one that is best left buried. I cannot, however, deny my interest in the "
"whys and wherefores of the grotesque fascination with disease expressed here."
"\n"
"\n"
"Now that I have documented my own immediate reactions to this text, I must "
"send it along to colleagues in Alinor to hopefully verify its authenticity. "
"Whether or not there is anything useful to be gained from it, at the very "
"least it may add to our understanding of a terrible enemy to all the races "
"of Tamriel in the unlikely event that such a threat re-emerges. If anything "
"contained herein is factual, let us pray to Auriel that it never does."

"do to even look at his face, covered in shame and smeared with lip paint.\n"

"this moment.\n"
"\n"
"The Sapiarchs have accepted us both as assistants. I'm to aid the Sapiarch "
"of Artifice, and Larydel has been accepted by the Sapiarch of Thaumaturgy. I "
"could near cry from happiness. I was so worried that only one of us would be "
"accepted, and the other would be left behind. I couldn't bear the thought of "
"parting with my dear brother, but now we don't have to. We can remain "
"together, as it's always been.\n"
"\n"
"Larydel was … shocked when he heard the news, I see that now. At first I "
"thought it was something akin to fear, but that's just silly. What reason "
"would he have to be frightened? No, it must just be surprise! Apprehension "
"perhaps over such a great honor being bestowed upon us.\n"
"\n"
"This is good. I've tried to not mind it, but Larydel has been so distant as "
"of late. I understand why he's chosen to live apart from me to conduct his "
"own research. After all, I've always feared I would hold him back. But when "
"we do meet, well …. \n"
"\n"
"Sometimes I barely recognize him. It's as if he's wearing a mask when we're "
"together. Even now, I can feel my chest tightening at the thought. No, I "
