"Vosh ball has a long and fabled history, going back to the earliest days of "
"the Orsimer people. As the Orcs gathered into clans, they developed the "
"concept of \"\"courage\"\" ball. It started not as a sport or recreational "
"pastime, but as a way to test the bravery and resilience of clan warriors.\n"
"\n"
"The earliest forms of vosh ball utilized a heavy sphere made of wood or "
"metal that was about the size of an Orc's head. The novice warrior to be "
"tested stood on the far end of a paced off court, staring down a battery of "
"veteran warriors, each armed with a vosh ball. The veterans would each toss "
"their vosh ball in turn, hurling it with as much strength as they could "
"muster. If the novice was still standing after the volley of heavy missiles "
"subsided, he proved his courage and was promoted higher into the warrior "
"ranks.\n"
"\n"
"As time went on, the test became an organized sport, with teams competing "
"for honor and recognition among the clans. The heavy metal ball was replaced "
"with a heavy leather ball, and rules and regulations were formalized and "
"agreed to among the participating clans.\n"
"\n"
"Today, no gathering of clans is complete without a rousing, multiple-day "
"vosh ball contest. Fharun clan holds the current record for ongoing "
"victories, winning the last seven \"\"series of the clans\"\" by wide "
"margins. Chief Bazrag of Fharun, the Fharun's most valuable player, has a "
"particularly nasty and powerful toss he affectionately refers to as \"\"the "
"bone-breaker.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"While the rules of vosh ball are constantly changing, the basic structure of "
"the game remains the same. Two teams of six Orcs each, all armed with a "
"sling of three vosh balls, competes to control the enclosed court by "
"rendering their opponents unconscious by hurling the heavy spheres with all "
"of their might. Beyond that, there are dozens of rules and regulations that "
"non-Orcs find confusing and contradictory. No matter. Anyone who has ever "
"witnessed the game played in all its glory comes away excited, breathless, "
"and with a renewed understanding of the definition of courage."

"An Excerpt\n"
"By Kraltha the Rememberer\n"
"\n"
"During the time of the Orsinium that was, the city that existed when the "
"temple now known as Ire was originally constructed, six Orc clans rose to "
"prominence in the region. Today, these particular clans have disappeared, "
"either absorbed into more powerful clans or simply faded away, but at their "
"height they had remarkable influence on Orc culture and the raising of "
"Orsinium. Let's look at these clans and the symbols that identified them.\n"
"\n"
"Clan Bragosh, the Hammer Clan\n"
"Known for their smithing skills, this clan created specialized armor and "
"weapons and was known as a trader of goods and supplies. Evidence suggests "
"the clan was eventually absorbed by the Morkul clan.\n"
"\n"
"Clan Pandrum, the Fire Clan\n"
"A clan rumored to be filled with primitive healers and shamans, they "
"supposedly controlled fire, using it as both a weapon and a tool to take "
"care of a variety of tasks. They seem to have disappeared from history after "
"the second siege of Orsinium.\n"
"\n"
"Clan Enclave, the Star Clan\n"
"Not much is known about this mysterious clan, other than they provided aid "
"to other clans for their own purposes. Rumors persist that the clan still "
"exists somewhere deep in the Wrothgar wilderness.\n"
"\n"
"Clan Luccin, the Wolf Clan\n"
"This clan was known for conducting effective and terrorizing raids during "
"the night. They were adept at moving through darkness and often took their "
"enemies completely by surprise. Some believe that the clan was eventually "
"absorbed by the Shatul clan.\n"
"\n"
"Clan Murtag, the Rock Clan\n"
"One of the oldest clans still in existence to the current day, this clan "
"makes its home in the mountains of Wrothgar, carving dwellings deep within "
"the very rock itself.\n"
"\n"
"Clan Ruskahr, the Owl Clan\n"
"A clan of highly skilled archers, they were known for their impressive "
"tracking and hunting skills. They revered owls of all types, but especially "
"the snow owl."

"By Bangor the Liar\n"
"\n"
"The battle for Orsinium raged on. The clans, already reeling from the "
"surprise attack, retreated into the temple as the Bretons finally broke "
"through the walls and swarmed into the city. The clan chiefs knew that  if "
"they did not escape soon, they would die inside their beloved temple.\n"
"\n"
"As they latched the temple doors behind them, the high chief turned and gave "
"instructions to his oldest son. \"\"You need to open the way to the tunnels "
"beneath the temple by setting the pillars correctly. Remember these words "
"and the way will be opened.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And with that, the high chief spoke the following words. \"\"My eyes gaze "
"upon the battlefield, but I feel calm. To my right, Clan Luccin fights with "
"ferocity and keeps our enemy at bay. To my left, Clan Bragosh serves as our "
"shield, protecting us from sights unseen. And above, Clan Ruskahr guards the "
"hills, bows at the ready.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"It was now up to the high chief's son. He had to remember the words, to call "
"upon his knowledge of the clans and their symbols, or the tunnels would "
"never open and the Orc clans would fall. He could not let that happen."

"From \"\"Secrets of an Orc City\"\"\n"
"By Grilbar the Architect\n"
"\n"
"When next the Orcs decided to rebuild the city of Orsinium, they determined "
"to create a series of tunnels beneath the streets that would serve as an "
"escape route should the city ever again fall under siege. These tunnels "
"still exist in the current day, with the newest stones of Orsinium being "
"laid atop their foundation.\n"
"\n"
"As the king's workers continue to build the city, some of the tunnels have "
"been sealed off or even collapsed. But many of the tunnels, hidden beneath "
"the ancient foundations of older structures, continue to crisscross below "
"the city streets. One of the most famous of these tunnels, described in the "
"fictional account \"\"The Battle of Orsinium,\"\" is the Temple Tunnel, "
"which was said to run from beneath the temple in Orsinium to the mountains "
"behind Scarp Keep.\n"
"\n"
"According to the work of fiction mentioned above, a secret passage guarded "
"the way to the tunnel. To access the tunnel, at least in the story, the high "
"chief's son had to solve a riddle to open the secret passage.\n"
"\n"
"I look forward to a time when the priests of the temple allow me the "
"opportunity to attempt to open the secret passage. Then we can determine "
"once and for all whether Bangor the Liar's tale is based on facts or truly "
"is a complete work of fiction."

"I've spent a fair amount of time researching the wildlife of Tamriel, from "
"the common (and fickle) mudcrab to the powerful and beastly wamasu of "
"Argonia. When I was invited to Orsinium, I jumped at the chance to explore "
"its untamed wilderness.\n"
"\n"
"Before we even arrived at the city of Orsinium, my caravan was attacked by "
"those filthy Winterborn. My protectors were either slain or fled into the "
"hills, so I tried to follow. I soon found myself lost. In my panic, I fell "
"into a small ravine. \n"
"\n"
"That was the last I remember before waking up, surrounded by blue-furred "
"giants. They seemed to take an interest in my well-being. Either that, or "
"they were keeping me alive so that they could devour me later. Ogres, while "
"technically of the Goblin-kin, are not known for their intelligence, but "
"they are far smarter than most animals. As a rule, I do not study the "
"intelligent races. Circumstances being what they were, I was intrigued "
"enough to record what I was able to observe. \n"
"\n"
"From what I saw, the ogres of the Wrothgarian foothills are far more "
"advanced than the crude brutes I've occasionally encountered near Wayrest. "
"Several of them, elders I suppose, seemed to practice some sort of crude "
"totemic magic that involved the manipulation of ice. One of them approached "
"me and studied me with as much interest as I showed in them. That was when "
"something amazing happened.\n"
"\n"
"My leg was broken and bleeding from my fall, and I couldn't move. The elder "
"raised his hand in the air and I braced for a strike. Instead, a beam of "
"energy coursed into my leg, freezing it. I could feel the wound stitching "
"together and the bone mending. The pain was excruciating, but I found it to "
"be exhilarating at the same time. \n"
"\n"
"As I stood up upon my mended leg, I heard grunts of panic and excitement "
"from the ogres nearby. I thought I had frightened them, but there was a "
"commotion from outside. The ogres, while not capable of conversing in the "
"common speech, do grunt and vocalize. They all repeated the same thing. "
"\"\"Urkazbur. Urkazbur!\"\" It was surreal. \n"
"\n"
"I exited the tent to find a scene of carnage. A larger, angrier ogre was "
"fighting the other ogres. The large one had bony claws strapped to his arms. "
"He slammed them into the ground. Ripples of ice shot out from the impact "
"sites, slamming into the others and knocking them down. The ogre who had "
"healed my leg tossed what appeared to be a glowing ball of snow at the "
"larger one. When it hit him, he reared back and shouted. He gestured and the "
"the snow around him rose up and formed into crude simulacrums and joined him "
"in the fight. \n"
"\n"
"While the ogres were distracted by all this violence, I escaped. Perhaps one "
"day when I've recovered fully, I'll return to see what became of "
"\"\"Urkazbur\"\" and his snow simulacrums."

"나에게 다가와서 내가 오우거들에게 가졌던 것과 비슷한 정도의 흥미를 가지고 날 자세히 살펴 보았다. 그러자 뭔가 놀라운 일이 일어났다.\n"

"내가 떨어졌을 때 다리는 부러지고 출혈이 있었던 상태였고, 따라서 난 움직일 수가 없었다. 그 장로가 손을 공중으로 들어 올렸고 난 "
"얻어맞을 것을 각오했다. 하지만 그 대신에, 어떤 기운의 빛줄기가 흘러들어와 내 다리를 냉각시켰다. 상처가 봉합되고 뼈가 회복되는 것을 "
"느낄 수 있었다. 고통은 몹시 심했지만, 동시에 상쾌한 기분도 느낄 수 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"내가 회복된 다리를 디디고 일어섰을 때, 근처의 오우거들이 내는 공황과 흥분의 울음소리가 들려왔다. 내가 오우거들을 놀라게 했다고 "
"생각했었지만, 소란은 바깥에서 들려오는 것이었다. 오우거들은 일반적인 대화를 할 능력이 없기 때문에 으르렁대는 소리로 의사를 표시한다. "

"단어였다.\n"

"뼈로 된 발톱을 묶어놓고 있었다. 놈이 다른 오우거들을 바닥에 내팽겨쳤다. 충격이 일어난 지점에서 얼음의 물결이 쏟아져나와 다른 "
"오우거들을 때려 넘어뜨렸다. 내 다리를 치료해줬던 오우거가 빛나는 눈덩이같은 것을 큰 놈에게 던졌다. 눈덩이가 큰 놈을 때리자, 놈은 "
"뒤로 물러서서 소리를 질렀다. 놈이 몸짓을 취하자 그 주변의 눈이 솟아나 놈처럼 생긴 엉성한 복제품이 되어 싸움에 가세했다.\n"

"creature ate his fine silk shirts. Apparently this monster, now the size of "
"a large tusked bull, liked to butt up against the supports of the Breton's "
"house and nearly knocked it down. \n"

"So far, I am quite pleased with the application of cold as a method for "
"turning people onto the path of Trinimac's holy light. I'm more certain than "
"ever that Graguz and his \"\"initiation\"\" of fire is a terrible approach "
"to recruitment. It has a poor survival rate. Besides, fire panics people, "
"and a panicked person cannot be reasoned with. A true conversion requires us "
"to get into the candidate's mind, show him or her a way out of their fear, "
"and help them come to the proper acceptance of Trinimac's holy grace. \n"
"\n"
"I think my method is a much more solid approach. (Ha. A pun. Solid. My ice "

"unnecessary panic. The added benefit of giving a recruit the option to end "

"My latest variation in the process seems to be the most effective yet. At "

"other candidate free! So, which one will decide to sacrifice their own life "
"so that the other may live? And the survivor? His or her guilt will open the "
"path for Trinimac's light. The survivor will accept Trinimac more fully "
"because he or she cannot accept that they caused another to die. The mind "
"and soul will belong to the Vosh Rakh, and Trinimac, utterly and completely.\n"

"Fire purges the incorrect thinking from the uninitiated. \n"

"Using specific stones for the unconvinced to stand upon is an important part "

"By Erisa Moorcroft, Scholar, Comparative Religious Studies\n"
"\n"
"I have never found it difficult to get an Orc to talk about his or her "
"beliefs when it comes to religion and the afterlife. As each Orc clan and "
"stronghold has a rich and vibrant oral tradition, this should come as no "
"surprise. What did surprise me was how hard it was to form a coherent "
"picture, as no two oral traditions agreed on even the most basic of concepts."
"\n"
"\n"
"In this time of conflicting faiths vying for the Orcish soul, I found many "
"of the tales I heard to be both extremely moving and extremely disturbing at "
"the same time. Furthermore, I have been unable to locate a single tome "
"related to the topic, or find a reference in any other books on related "
"subjects. The only way to learn about the Orcish concept of life after death "
"or a place of reward or punishment in a world beyond was by asking the right "
"questions and listening to the various oral traditions. For after much "
"research and countless interviews, I finally uncovered the Orc equivalent to "
"the tales of the Far Shores and Sovngarde. Indeed, it was the only thing "
"that the various oral traditions seemed to agree upon. And through them, I "
"have discovered the Ashen Forge.\n"
"\n"
"For the Orcs that revere Malacath, the afterlife promises rewards of "
"immortality, abundant food and drink, and constant battle deep within the "
"Ashen Forge. The Ashen Forge represents the culmination of the three "
"constant truths of life among the Orc clans: the stronghold, the grudge, and "
"the Code of Malacath. Let me explain each of these concepts and discuss how "
"they relate to the Orc afterlife so that the meaning becomes clear (or at "
"least as clear as each different stronghold attempts to make it). What "
"follows is my best attempt to merge the divergent and sometimes conflicting "
"tales into a single narrative.\n"
"\n"
"The Ashen Forge sits at the center of Malacath's own stronghold in the "
"Ashpit. According to some scholars, Malacath's plane of Oblivion consists of "
"nothing but dust and smoke and ash. But his followers believe that the "
"eternal emptiness contains all the things they hold dear and deem necessary "
"to enhance their immortal existence. As the ultimate expression of the Orc "
"stronghold, Malacath's Ashpit bastion stretches endlessly across the planes, "
"extending even behind the stars to Aetherius, granting access to every "
"worthy Orc who crosses from this life into the next. In Malacath's "
"stronghold, every Orc is a chief, every chief has a thousand wives, and "
"every wife has a thousand slaves to cater to their every need. The "
"stronghold's walls rise one hundred feet into the smoky sky, constructed of "
"polished steel and worked iron. Inside the walls, stone keeps, iron towers, "
"and massive longhouses surround the central square that houses the Ashen "
"Forge.\n"
"\n"
"The Ashen Forge fills the endless space within Malacath's smithy, a massive "
"hearth that burns with a fire said to be hotter than the sun. The thing that "
"keeps this fire alive is the adherence by the Orcs of Tamriel to the Code of "
"Malacath, but more on that later. Within this fire, every Orc must undergo "
"the ritual of tempering when first they cross from this life to the next. "
"They are thrust into the coals so that every grudge that he or she carried "
"into the afterlife can be heated, melted, and eventually forged into the "
"next generation of mortal Orcs. With the grudges of Tamriel tempered and "
"returned to the mortal world, the immortal Orcs are now free to begin "
"collecting a new set of grudges related to their new existence. Some "
"particularly memorable grudges can also be hammered and worked into weapons "
"or armor of legendary stature upon the Ashen Anvil, the gigantic work bench "
"that stands beside the Ashen Forge.\n"
"\n"
"The heat that fires the Ashen Forge comes from the burning, white-hot coals "
"that are, according to the Orc lore-masters who would talk to me, the "
"literal manifestation of the bloody Code of Malacath. They believe that the "
"code fuels the fires of emptiness, betrayal, and broken promises, imbuing "
"every newly forged Orc with a foundation of grievances and resentments that "
"will take them far in the mortal world. The hope is that every generation "
"will be better than the next thanks to the efforts of the generation before "
"it and its ability to adhere to and follow the Code of Malacath.\n"
"\n"
"Still, Malacath's faithful believe that they will be rewarded with "
"immortality, nourishment, and constant battle deep within the Ashen Forge. A "
"life-everlasting filled with endless days of warfare, endless nights of fine "
"food and drink, and ongoing opportunities to prove their toughness and "
"demonstrate the quality of their steel.\n"
"\n"
"Fascinating, really, especially when contrasted against the beliefs of "
"Trinimac's followers. Unlike the oral traditions of Malacath that twist and "
"grow with each telling at every different stronghold, the traditions of "
"Trinimac's faithful was surprisingly consistent and they were happy to share "
"them with me. High Priestess Solgra, especially, was extremely helpful in "
"the preparation of this report. When a follower of Trinimac dies, she "
"explained, he or she ascends to Aetherius to join with their ancestors. It "
"seems that the afterlife for Trinimac's faithful also consists of endless "
"war and celebrations, but with a greater emphasis on once again spending "
"time with family members who came before you. In the end, I guess I found "
"the Trinimac version to be somewhat tame when compared to the more savage "
"and visceral beliefs of Malacath's faithful."

"All right you slack-jawed, Elf-loving, inglorious bastards—simmer down! "
"We're here today because some of you ugly runts have been complaining about "
"a lack of \"\"honor\"\" in the arena, or some ox-piss like that. Look at "
"you—a bunch of tuskless whelps with your heads up your arses! It's probably "
"a waste of time, but I'm going to try to pound some hard-earned knowledge "

"\n"
"Honor. Bah! Let me tell you something about honor. Honor is the excuse that "

"\n"

"\n"
"Never let your opponent see. Dirt, snow, a flick of blood—just as useful as "

"crumpets! You should be jawing about their ugly mothers, and their sister's "
"creaky bed, and their father's yellow belly. It's best if you know these "
"folks by name. It also helps a lot if what you're saying contains a ring of "
"truth. And it's not enough to just say it—you've got to mean it! Angry "
"fighters make mistakes, and mistakes will make it easier for you to kill "
"them.\n"

"A Study of a Religion Reborn by Ugdorga, the King's Scribe\n"
"\n"
"For generations, Orcs have believed in three constant truths: the "
"stronghold, the grudge, and the fury of Malacath. But before Malacath, at "
"least according to certain traditions and a few noted scholars, there was "
"Trinimac. The Vosh Rakh, a newly emerged movement that seems to be gaining "
"in numbers and popularity, promises to take Orcs back to the roots of who "
"and what they are as a people. To reclaim the glory of the warrior god "
"Trinimac and restore the Orcs to their proper position in the world.\n"
"\n"
"Is it any wonder that this new religion has found adherents among those who "
"have accepted the idea of a reborn Orsinium? For its beliefs and tenets seem "
"tailor-made for the vision of a united Wrothgar. The Vosh Rakh claim they "
"want to \"\"civilize\"\" the wild and riotous nature of the Orcs. They want "
"to elevate the Orcs, to place them on the same level as the other races—or "
"perhaps even to set them higher. And they want to rebuild the ancient city "
"of Orsinium, setting it as the jewel in the crown of a new and powerful Orc "
"nation. That said, although King Kurog has provided support for the new "
"faith in Trinimac, going so far as to establish a temple in Orsinium, he "
"appears to have no connection to the more-extremist followers of the Vosh "
"Rakh.\n"
"\n"
"Who are the Vosh Rakh? That's not an easy question to answer. For every "
"member of the movement keeps his or her identity secret, and when they come "
"together to celebrate or pray, they wear golden masks of Orcish visages "
"patterned after Trinimac's own auric-tinged skin. The name itself translates "
"from the Orcish tongue as \"\"Blade of Courage\"\" and refers to Trinimac's "
"legendary weapon, Penitent. They see themselves as Trinimac's sword made "
"manifest, cutting a new path through the ancient and stifling traditions "
"that—as they put it—have \"\"held back the Orsimer people for untold "
"generations.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Many among the Orcish old guard see the Vosh Rakh as either a foolish fad "
"that will soon fade away or as dangerous fanatics who will stop at nothing "
"to destroy the Orcish way of life. Either way, the old guard refuses to be "
"swayed by the arguments and the promises. They won't abandon the traditions "
"that make Orcs—as they put it—\"\"strong and powerful and better than any "
"puny Elf.\"\" They hold fast to the concept of the stronghold and the clan, "
"rejecting the call to create a single Orc nation. They maintain the grudge, "
"for ill will and resentment fuel the fire in their bellies and the anger in "
"their hearts. And they maintain their steadfast faith in Malacath, god of "
"curses and the betrayed, for he blesses them with conflict and the bloody "
"Code of Malacath.\n"
"\n"
"But the Vosh Rakh see the old guard as simply another challenge that "
"Trinimac will help them overcome. Malacath, they claim, is nothing more than "
"a weak and vengeful pretender trying to steal Trinimac's glory. Once the "
"Orcs accept Trinimac and come together as a united people, then Trinimac "
"will bless them with aid and succor in every battle set before them—from the "
"battle to rebuild Orsinium, to the war against the Reachmen, and to fighting "
"for honor and prestige among the other races, Trinimac will bring victory "
"and glory to all.\n"
"\n"
"End Note: At the time of this writing, rumors have begun to circulate "
"claiming that the Vosh Rakh has begun using deceitful, even deadly, tactics "
"in their battle to win the hearts and minds of the Orcs. I have yet to "
"substantiate these rumors as anything more than the angry words of members "
"of the old guard, but I thought I should include them here. I will attempt "
"to learn more and record my findings in a latter volume."

"Oh what a legend we have wrought! Who would ever dare to challenge the "
"powerful and immortal Thukhozod, master of the necromantic arts? Thukhozod "
"is, was, and forever shall be. He appeared hundreds of years ago and "
"established a hidden sanctum where he could perform his rituals and "
"experiments in relative peace. He frightens the locals, he communes with "
"chiefs and warlords, and he consults with the spirits of the dead.\n"
"\n"
"Now, as I enter my thirtieth year as Thukhozod the Eternal, I have decided "
"to write down our dirty little secret. Thukhozod isn't one, he's many, and I "
"am just the latest in a long line of powerful necromancers.\n"
"\n"
"The first Thukhozod was the original Thukhozod, an Orc necromancer with a "
"plan and a dream. He claimed to be immortal when he participated in the "
"Three Clans War, and certainly his efforts were recognized as significantly "
"contributing to the victory of Shatul Clan. But I don't believe what "
"happened next was his idea. I think that credit should go to his son, Glazoz."
"\n"
"\n"
"When Thukhozod died unexpectedly, his son and apprentice Glazoz decided to "
"keep the event a secret. He dealt with his father's body and took on his "
"identity. In that way, Thukhozod continued and his march toward immortality "
"was on.\n"
"\n"
"The list of Orcs, each and every one an ancestor of mine, goes on for pages "
"and is stored in a hidden vault deep within this sanctum. It includes at "
"least two daughters who replaced their fathers and took on the role without "
"giving any indication as to their true genders. Now, as this damnable "
"illness eats away at me, I await the arrival of my own son, Khoruzoth. His "
"mother, Yazoga, was supposed to present him with his heritage. He should be "
"on his way as I write this. I hope he arrives while I'm still healthy enough "
"to help him with the transition to his new life."

"\n"
"Now I want to take a few pages to record King Kurog's grand vision for "
"Wrothgar and the Orc nation. I listened to his plan develop over the years "
"from a nebulous dream, to a kernel of an idea, to the strategy that now "
"inspires the re-building of Orsinium. \n"
"\n"
"During one of our first rendezvous, Kurog imbibed an astonishing amount of "
"moon-sugar double rum. This had the effect of making him both introspective "
"and extremely talkative. With a few smiles, a well-placed giggle, and an "
"occasional compliment or question, I was able to get Kurog to open up about "
"a great many things. But as the evening wore on, he began to tell me about "
"his dream for the Orsimer—his name for the people we call Orcs. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"The strongholds,\"\" Kurog said. \"\"They've served the Orsimer well for "
"generations. But our traditions, for all they aid and guide us, they also "
"hold us back. They mire us in outdated notions and meaningless restrictions."
"\"\" There was more, of course. While he understood the need for violence "
"and was extremely good at it, he hated that everything in the strongholds "
"was solved by beating or killing someone or another. \"\"It makes it very "
"hard to have a civil discourse on anything of substance,\"\" he bemoaned, "
"\"\"because sooner or later someone reaches for something heavy or sharp to "
"use to punctuate their particular point of view. Something needs to change."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The next time the subject came up, we were drinking treacle tea and watching "
"the sun set over the Tenmar Forest. It was obvious that Kurog had given the "
"topic much thought since we had last discussed it. In addition to just "
"making life better for the Orsimer, now he also wanted to elevate his people "
"on the political level as well. \"\"The other kingdoms will never take us "
"seriously as long as we remain trapped in our old traditions,\"\" he said, a "
"trace of bitterness evident in his voice. \"\"We must develop a modern "
"society if we are ever to stand shoulder to shoulder with the other races as "
"equals. We need to build Orsimer towns and cities that can sustain diplomacy "
"and trade while not looking like ancient and restrictive fortresses. A "
"little fear in your contemporaries is all well and good. I find that it "
"helps immensely in negotiations. But attitudes and mannerisms that invoke "
"terror? Those should be locked away and reserved for your enemies, not left "
"on constant display to frighten friends and foes alike.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"It was my final day in Elsweyr. I was preparing to return to Wayrest after "
"what I assumed was going to be my last extended stay in the Khajiiti "
"countryside, when Kurog invited me to join him for dinner. He had reserved a "
"private room at the local inn and paid the establishment's chef to prepare a "
"farewell feast for the two of us to share. As we munched on dried sugarmeat "
"and caramelized sweetcakes, Kurog picked up his ongoing narrative of how he "
"was going to return home and help his people. \"\"I plan to rebuild our past "
"glory, perhaps by reestablishing Yashnag's ancient Orsimer kingdom in "
"Falkreath or maybe even raising the ruins of Orsinium itself.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kurog's dream had become goal, a challenge he had placed upon himself to "
"test his mettle and his strength of spirit. It would begin with Kurog's "
"return to Wrothgar to wrest the chiefdom of his clan from the \"\"insolent "
"leader who wasn't fit to shine a young Orc's tusks\"\" (his words, not mine)."
" Then he would gather other clan leaders to his banner, forming a nation of "
"independent states that was large enough and powerful enough to carve a "
"kingdom for the Orcs—a kingdom that would see Kurog as its king. \"\"Tell "
"Emeric that the next time we meet, it will be as equals or it will be as "
"enemies!\"\" Kurog said. \"\"Under my rule, Orsimer will have every right "
"and opportunity afforded to the citizens of Wayrest or Windhelm. The old "
"ways will fall away, and a new age will dawn for the Orsimer people. This I "
"so pledge!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I won't deny it. Kurog's words, his passion, they moved me. I wanted to "
"believe that he would succeed, that the Orcs would rise up and prosper under "
"his benign rule. I would never forget what he described to me. Later, when "
"King Emeric was in desperate need of allies, I would remember Kurog and "
"whisper into Emeric's ear. And that is how alliances are born."

"계획이 모호한 꿈에서 핵심적인 생각으로, 이제 오시니움을 재건하겠다는 전략으로 발전하는 것을 들었다.\n"
"\n"
"우리의 첫 만남 중 한때, 쿠로그는 놀라운 양의 문-슈가 더블 럼주를 마신 적 있었다. 그러자 쿠로그는 완전히 내성적이면서 극도로 말이 "
"많아졌다. 약간의 미소를 짓고 킥킥거리며, 그리고 종종 칭찬을 하거나 질문을 하며 나는 쿠로그가 많은 것을 털어 놓도록 할 수 있었다. "

"우린 현대 사회로 발전해야만 하오. 오시머 마을과 도시를 고대의 제한적인 요새가 아닌 외교와 거래가 가능하게 만들어야 하오. 동시대를 "

"작별 연회를 준비하게 했다. 우리가 말린 설탕고기와 설탕에 졸인 달콤한 케익을 아삭아삭 씹고 있을 때, 쿠로그가 고향으로 돌아가 어떻게 "

"Let's talk about the wives of King Kurog of Wrothgar. He began collecting "
"wives shortly after he returned to Wrothgar and defeated Bolazgar to become "
"chief of his clan. His first selections were purely political, taking wives "
"to shore up his alliances with other clans. It was about this time that I "
"became aware of Kurog's mother, Alga. He had mentioned her a few times in "
"conversations we had over the years, but she never seemed to be a major "
"influence in his life. At least, she wasn't prominent in his life as a "
"mercenary.\n"
"\n"
"Now that Kurog was chief of his clan, his mother had stepped in to fill a "
"need he never knew he had. She took the title of Grand Forge-Mother and "
"immediately set out to negotiate marriages for her son. For those of you not "
"intimately familiar with Orc traditions, you must understand that the only "
"male in a clan allowed to take wives is the chief. He functions sort of like "
"the primary male in a pride of lions, lording over all until someone younger "
"and stronger comes along to take his crown. Just as Kurog did with Bolazgar. "
"The chief's wives become the highest-ranking people in the stronghold, "
"taking charge of important clan functions while the chief supervises "
"everything from a distance. The only activity the chief personally takes "
"charge of is war, whether leading raids or actually taking his clan into "
"battle against a hated enemy.\n"
"\n"
"The most-influential and powerful of the chief's wives is the hunt-wife, and "
"this was the first marriage that Alga worked to secure. Rumors abound that "
"more than a dozen young hopefuls were vying for the position, but Alga and "
"Kurog had a specific goal in mind. In the end, a powerful daughter from the "
"Shatul clan, famed hunters of the Wrothgar highlands, was selected to "
"solidify the alliance between the clans. Noroga pledged her loyalty, taking "
"her place as Kurog's hunt-wife.\n"
"\n"
"When it came time to find Kurog a forge-wife to oversee blacksmithing and "
"mining for the clan, Alga looked no further than the famed weapon and armor "
"smiths of the Morkul clan. The obvious choice was the Morkul chief's eldest "
"daughter, an Orc maiden named Ashaka. But Alga was more interested in the "
"younger Tugha, who had traveled abroad for two years to study with the "
"blacksmiths of western Skyrim. Her experiences, modern attitudes, and "
"obvious intelligence won her the position of forge-wife for Kurog and his "
"clan.\n"
"\n"
"If there was a requirement other than bringing another powerful clan under "
"Kurog's banner, the role of hearth-wife demanded not only a brilliant "
"household administrator but a talent for cooking that went beyond the usual "
"skills of a mountain-bear hash-slinger. Kurog, as I've mentioned in previous "
"volumes of this chronicle, relished food with a passion. Between fighting "
"and eating, I'd be hard-pressed to determine which activity Kurog enjoyed "
"more. Be that as it may, it would take years to find someone of Orcish grace "
"and exceptional talent to fill this marital role. A great competition was "
"eventually staged while Kurog was off aiding King Emeric at the end of "
"Ranser's War. \n"
"\n"
"While Kurog was away, at least according to my sources, Forge-Mother Alga "
"invited the most eligible Orc maidens from the most powerful clans not yet "
"allied with Kurog to compete for the title of hearth-wife. She made them "
"engage in a culinary battle that was as violent and bloody as any skirmish "
"Kurog himself had ever undertaken. The women had to track, kill, and clean "
"their own ingredients. They had to fight each other to secure spices from "
"distant lands. And then they had to present their finished meals before time "
"ran out. Alga and Kurog's first wives, Noroga and Tugha, would judge the "
"worth of each contestant's offering. Barazal of Clan Murtag won the day, as "
"much for her physical strength (it is said she killed a mountain bear with "
"her bare hands) as her deft use of delicate spices. \n"
"\n"
"Kurog has many and varied lesser wives, most of who I have no real knowledge "
"of, as they work behind the scenes and rarely made their presence known. "
"Two, however, are always at Kurog's side. These are his protectors, the "
"shield-wives. Two powerful fighters currently fill these roles in Kurog's "
"household, the warrior-sisters Oshgatha and Razbela. The sisters are as "
"loyal to each other as they are to the king, ready to lay down their lives "
"to defend him should the need arise. Even Noroga and Tugha remain on best "
"behavior when the shield-wives are present.\n"
"\n"
"Note: Though each marriage secured Kurog a certain degree of cooperation "
"from the various clans, I should point out that since Kurog took the title "
"of king, some of the clan chiefs who joined with Kurog by virtue of his "
"marriage to their daughters have had a change of heart. While these chiefs "
"won't openly oppose Kurog due to the marriage alliance, they have yet to "
"publicly accept him as king of the Orcs. This, as you can probably guess, "
"makes Kurog extremely unhappy."

"로스가 쿠로그 왕의 아내들에 대해 이야기해 보자. 쿠로그는 로쓰가로 돌아와 볼라즈가를 물리치고 부족장이 된 직후 아내를 수집하기 시작했다."
" 그의 첫 간택은 다른 부족과의 동맹을 강화하기 위해 아내를 데려오는 순수하게 정치적인 것이었다. 내가 쿠로그의 어머니 알가를 알게 된 "
"것은 그 쯤이었다. 쿠로그는 지난 몇 년 동안 대화를 하며 알가에 대해 언급했지만, 그녀는 결코 쿠로그의 삶에 큰 영향력이 있는 것 같지 "
"않았다. 어쨌든 알가는 쿠로그의 용병으로서의 삶에서 중요하지 않았다.\n"
"\n"
"쿠로그가 부족장이 되자, 그의 어머니는 쿠로그가 절대 몰랐던 필요성을 충족해주려 개입했다. 그녀는 위대한 대장간대모라는 직함을 들고 즉시 "
"아들을 위해 결혼을 교섭하기 시작했다. 오크의 문화와 친숙하지 않은 사람들은 부족에서 아내를 취할 수 있는 남자는 오직 부족장밖에 없다는 "
"사실을 알아야 할 것이다. 쿠로그는 사자 떼의 우두머리 수컷과 같았고 더 젊고 강한 이가 왕관을 차지하러 도전할 때까지 모두에게 군림했다."
" 쿠로그가 볼라즈가에게 그랬던 것처럼 말이다. 부족의 아내들은 요새에서 가장 높은 사람이 되어 족장이 멀리서 모든 것을 관리하는 동안 "
"부족의 중요한 일을 책임진다. 부족장이 직접 책임지는 유일한 활동은 전쟁 뿐이다. 기습을 이끌든 부족을 미워하는 적과 싸우는 전투에 "
"데려가든 말이다.\n"
"\n"
"족장의 아내 중 가장 강력하고 영향력 있는 것은 사냥부인이다. 그리고 그 결혼은 알가가 성사시킨 최초의 결혼이었다. 희망에 찬 젊은이들 "
"열 댓 명 이상이 사냥부인 자리를 놓고 다퉜다는 소문이 있었지만, 알가와 쿠로그는 마음에 명확한 목표를 가지고 있었다. 마침내, 로쓰가 "
"산악 지대의 유명한 사냥꾼들인 샤툴 부족의 강력한 딸이 두 부족 간의 동맹을 굳히기 위해 간택 되었다.\n"
"\n"
"부족을 위해 제련과 광산 일을 감독할 대장간부인을 찾아 줄 때가 오자, 알가는 무기와 방어구 제련으로 유명한 모쿨 부족을 들여다 봤다. "
"아샤카라는 이름의 모쿨 부족장의 장녀가 선택 되었다. 하지만 알가는 2년 동안 스카이림 서부의 제련을 공부하러 해외에 다녀온 젊은 "
"투가에게 더 관심이 있었다. 투가는 그녀의 경험과 세련된 태도, 그리고 분명한 지적 능력으로 쿠로그와 부족의 대장간부인을 차지하게 되었다."
"\n"
"\n"
"쿠로그의 휘장 아래 또 다른 강력한 부족을 데려와야 할 일이 있었다면, 그것은 난로부인이었다. 난로부인은 똑똑한 가사 관리자일 뿐만 "
"아니라 요리에도 평범한 재주 이상의 재능이 있어야 했다. 이 연대기의 지난 권에서 언급했듯이, 쿠로그는 음식을 아주 좋아했다. 싸우는 "
"것과 먹는 것 중에서 쿠로그가 더 즐기는 활동이 무엇인지 결정하는 것은 아주 힘든 일이다. 그러니 이 부부 역할을 채울 오크의 품위와 "
"놀라운 재능을 가진 누군가를 찾는 데 몇 년이 걸렸을 것이다. 쿠로그가 랜서 왕의 전쟁 끝무렵에 에머릭 왕을 도우러 떠나 있는 동안 결국 "
"큰 대회가 열렸다.\n"
"\n"
"쿠로그가 없는 동안 최소한 내 정보에 따르면, 대장간대모 알가는 아직 쿠로그와 동맹을 맺지 않은 가장 강력한 부족들에서 신부감이 될 만한 "
"아가씨들을 초대했다. 난로부인감을 찾기 위해서였다. 알가는 쿠로그는 결코 겪지 않았을 폭력적이고 피 튀는 요리 전투에 그녀들이 참여하게 "
"했다. 여자들은 요리 재료들을 추격하고, 죽이고, 씻었다. 그들은 먼 땅에서 향신료를 얻기 위해 서로 싸워야만 했다. 그리고 그들은 "
"시간이 끝나기 전에 요리를 완성해 제출해야 했다. 알가와 쿠로그의 첫 번째 아내들인 노로가와 투가가 각각의 경쟁자들의 음식을 평가할 "
"것이었다. 무르타그 부족의 바라잘이 이 날 승리했다. 은은한 향신료를 능숙하게 다루는 그녀의 육체적인 힘도 대단했다. (바라잘은 맨손으로 "
"산맥 곰을 죽였다고 한다.)\n"
"\n"
"쿠로그에게는 많고 다양한 아내들이 있었다. 덜 중요한 아내들에 대해서는 대부분 잘 알지 못했고, 그녀들은 무대 뒤에서 존재를 거의 "
"드러내지 않았다. 하지만 둘은 항상 쿠로그의 곁에 있었다. 쿠로그의 보호자인 방패부인들이다. 강력한 투사인 오쉬가싸와 라즈벨라 전사 자매 "
"둘이 쿠로그의 가정에서 현재 이 역할을 맡고 있다. 자매는 왕에게 충성스러운 만큼 서로에게도 그러했고 쿠로그를 지키기 위해 필요하다면 "
"자신들의 목숨을 내놓을 준비도 되어 있었다. 노로가와 투가조차 방패부인들이 있을 때면 진중하게 행동했다.\n"
"\n"
"주의: 쿠로그가 했던 각각의 결혼이 다양한 부족을 어느 정도 연합시켰지만, 쿠로그가 왕이라는 직함을 쓴 이후로 딸을 그와 결혼시켰던 몇몇 "
"부족장은 마음을 바꾸었다. 결혼 동맹 때문에 이 부족장들은 공개적으로 쿠로그에 반대하지는 않지만, 아직 그를 오크의 왕으로 공공연하게 "
"받아 들이지는 않았다. 그리고 당신이 추측할 수 있듯이, 이것이 쿠로그의 기분을 아주 나쁘게 만들었다."

"As the years went by, I was often used as an intermediary between King "
"Emeric and Chief Kurog. Because of this, and due to my ongoing friendship "
"with the chief, I was privy to many of the most significant events in "
"Kurog's life. And not only to the events, but also to Kurog's thoughts and "
"feelings, because he continued to trust me and utilize me as a confidant, "
"even writing to me when we were in different parts of the continent. (But, "
"sadly, no. I never took him up on his offer to become one of his wives. "
"Kurog began to collect wives early in his chiefdom, not unlike a stable "
"master collects horses. But that's a tale for another day.)\n"
"\n"
"Kurog spent a few years consolidating his power, growing his clan and "
"forming alliances with clan chiefs that were willing to support his goals "
"and ideals. It was about this time that Kurog revealed the details of his "
"grand vision. \"\"I will follow in the footsteps of mighty Yashnag and march "
"into Skyrim,\"\" he wrote to me. \"\"I will restore the Orcish kingdom in "
"Falkreath and create an Orcish city to rival the wondrous Wayrest.\"\" While "
"Kurog was busy to the north, King Emeric was dealing with issues in central "
"High Rock. King Ranser of Shornhelm had declared war against Wayrest. After "
"a clandestine meeting with the king, I decided I had to make one more trip "
"to stand at Kurog's side.\n"
"\n"
"I caught up with Kurog near Dragonstar, as his forces were accumulating in "
"the mountains of western Skyrim. They were having a more difficult time of "
"it than Kurog had anticipated. The Nords, wracked as they were by civil war, "
"nonetheless proved to be capable and courageous fighters. The path to "
"Falkreath was long and arduous, and the rock and snow were going to be "
"bathed in the blood of warriors from both sides before this campaign was "
"done. I sat with Kurog one night, watching the roaring fire, when the clan "
"chief opened up as he did during our times together back in Elsweyr.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"These damn Nords,\"\" Kurog said, \"\"if they had a shred of decency "
"they'd put down their weapons and get out of our way. But no. The clans that "
"aren't fighting us are trying to bribe us to aid their cause. They don't see "
"us as conquerors. They think we're mercenaries! I'm beginning to think that "
"my Falkreath dream is going to be crushed by all this snow and ice. Damn the "
"Nords and damn their foul mead!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I placed a hand on Kurog's knee and said softly, \"\"What if I offered you a "
"different, better dream? And the authority to make that dream a reality?\"\" "
"Kurog looked at me for a long time. Then he stood, towering over me, and "
"demanded to know what I was talking about. Instead, I reached into my "
"traveling cloak, withdrew a leather document pouch, and handed it to him. He "
"read the contents by the light of the fire. Read it again. And a third time. "
"Then he asked me if this was some sort of trick. I assured him that it "
"wasn't a trick. It was an offer. \"\"You help King Emeric, and King Emeric "
"helps you,\"\" I said, and the two of us talked long into the deepening "
"night.\n"
"\n"
"In the morning, Kurog had a list of demands for me to take back to Wayrest. "
"I was impressed. He was driving a hard bargain, but he was also offering "

"The journey to Wrothgar turned out to be more pleasant than I expected. "
"Kurog continued to be a fun and exciting companion. If anything, his mood "
"grew even lighter the closer we got to the land of his birth. Along the way, "
"we talked of many things, including Kurog's hopes to change some of the more "
"oppressive and restrictive traditions of his people. \"\"We should build "
"great cities, cosmopolitan communities with places of learning and "
"culture,\"\" Kurog said. \"\"And cuisine. Lots and lots of cuisine. It's so "
"much better than food.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"When we finally crossed the border into Wrothgar, the mood among Kurog's "
"company of Orcs turned somber and more serious. They knew the stakes of "
"siding with Kurog against their clan chief and were prepared to deal with "
"those consequences, but that didn't make marching toward possible doom any "
"easier. Kurog, on the other hand, maintained a jovial, even childlike, glee. "
"He had prepared for this moment his entire life, and he was ready to leap "
"head-first into his destiny. I was afraid for him, but I was also honored to "
"call him my friend. And, if I may be so bold, just watching Kurog riding "
"tall and proud atop his horse made my heart beat a little faster. I guess I "
"was a bit smitten with the charismatic Orc warrior.\n"
"\n"
"At some point Kurog must have noticed that I was staring at him. He gave me "
"a dazzling Orc smile, winked, and said, \"\"Once I become chief, you could "
"be one of my wives. Consider that an open invitation.\"\" I turned away, "
"hoping he didn't see how flush my face had become. I didn't know if I should "
"laugh or scream in angry mortification at such a ludicrous idea. But by the "
"time I gathered my thoughts and turned back to confront him, Kurog was "
"holding up one gauntleted hand. \"\"From here,\"\" he said, \"\"I go on "
"alone.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Chief Bolazgar waited for Kurog. Four large, hulking Orc warriors stood "
"beside the chief, their angry gazes locked on the younger Orc. And beyond "
"them, it seemed to me like the entire clan had come out to see what was "
"about to occur. \"\"Are you going to grovel before your chief and beg my "
"forgiveness, Kurog?\"\" Bolazgar sneered. \"\"No, not today,\"\" Kurog "
"replied cheerfully. \"\"Today, I challenge you for leadership of the clan."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Even from a distance, I could see that Chief Bolazgar was shaking with rage. "
"\"\"How dare you?\"\" he bellowed. \"\"Do you think you can best me in fair "
"combat? Do you?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kurog shrugged. \"\"As a matter of fact, I know I can best you. You've grown "
"fat and weak while I've been fighting wars in distant lands,\"\" Kurog "
"proclaimed. \"\"In fact, I'm not sure there's going to be anything fair "
"about this combat.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"With a scream of pure hatred, Bolazgar drew his weapon and charged. In stark "
"contrast, Kurog calmly unsheathed his sword and stood his ground. Then, with "
"an economy of motion, he blocked the clan chief's initial, clumsy attack, "
"and followed that with a single, devastating swipe. Bolazgar's head bounced "
"three times before it came to rest against the boot of one of his honor "
"guards.\n"
"\n"
"The field was silent for a long moment. Then the first call went out, "
"\"\"Long live Chief Kurog.\"\" The rest of the clan took up the chant as "
"each member, in turn, dropped to one knee before the powerful Kurog. He "
"smiled. \"\"Today begins a new day for the Orsimer!\"\" Kurog proclaimed. "
"\"\"I will lead you to glory! On this, you have my word!\"\"\n"

"as to my true nature. \"\"Damn it all, why not? She's amusing, she knows how "

"I first met Kurog gro-Bagrakh in the wilds of Elsweyr. I was there "
"pretending to be a scholar from Wayrest, but my true purpose was to watch, "
"listen, and report back to King Emeric of Wayrest about events in the "
"Khajiiti homeland. It was in this capacity as a spy that I originally "
"encountered the boisterous and charismatic Orc warrior. He was newly arrived "
"from Wrothgar, busy establishing himself in the mercenary group known as "
"Gaspard's Stalkers. From all reports, he was brave, competent, and of "
"unmatched physical prowess. He certainly looked the part to me.\n"
"\n"
"The Breton mercenary leader, Gaspard Esmery, opened his ranks to any and all "
"races. As long as you were willing to follow orders and fight with all your "
"strength, Gaspard had a place for you in his unit. Kurog brought along a "
"handful of powerful Orcs who also happened to be extremely loyal to the "
"young warrior. Soon, they were the most-prominent members of the Stalkers, "
"getting the most-dangerous missions and the ogre's share of the loot.\n"
"\n"
"I was able to get close to Kurog on a number of occasions. He enjoyed being "
"flirted with, especially by an attentive Breton woman who enjoyed sampling "
"Khajiiti delicacies as much as he did. During these moments when we met for "
"food and drink, he let down his guard and told me things I'm sure he "
"wouldn't have revealed to any of his male acquaintances. It was during one "
"such rendezvous, in a dark and seedy tavern in the city of Orcrest, that I "
"learned about the Orc warrior's past and his dreams for the future. \n"
"\n"
"We have all heard the horrible stories of life in the Orc strongholds. Kurog "
"told me of his younger days as part of a clan in distant Wrothgar. He was "
"the best and the brightest of a new crop of younglings—stronger, faster, and "
"in many ways more brilliant than either his contemporaries or most of his "
"elders. But he was unsatisfied with life in the clan. He wanted to prove "
"himself in battle. He wanted to see the world. And both he and his clan "
"chief knew that if he remained in the stronghold much longer, one of them "
"was going to die. That was the way of life for the Orcs.\n"
"\n"
"Instead of pushing the issue and challenging the chief, Kurog rallied his "

"Hammerfell and Cyrodiil, the company had made its way to Elsweyr. Kurog "

"자리를 잡느라 바빴다. 모든 보고에 의하면, 그는 용감했고, 유능했으며, 필적할 수 없는 육체적 능력을 가지고 있었다. 그는 확실히 내게 "
"꼭 필요한 사람 같았다.\n"
"\n"
"브레튼 용병단장인 가스파트 에스머리는 누구에게나 어떤 종족에게나 열려 있다. 기꺼이 명령을 따르고 온 힘을 다해 싸울 마음이 있는 한, "
"가스파드는 용병으로 받아 들일 것이다. 쿠로그는 그 젊은 전사에게 매우 충성스러운 강력한 오크 몇 명을 데리고 왔다. 곧, 그들은 가장 "
"위험한 임무를 맡고 오거의 전리품을 획득하며 스토커들 중 가장 유명해졌다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 여러 차례 쿠로그와 어울릴 수 있었다. 그는 추파를 받는 것을 즐겼다. 특히 자신 만큼 카짓의 별미를 좋아하는 다정한 브레튼 여성을 "
"좋아했다. 우리가 식사를 하고 술을 마시는 동안, 그는 경비를 물리고 내게 말했다. 그가 자신의 남자 지인들에게 어떤 것도 드러내 보이지 "
"않을 거란 걸 내가 확신하고 있다고. 오크레스트의 어둡고 지저분한 선술집에서 있었던 만남이었다. 그 곳에서 나는 그 오크 전사의 과거와 "
"미래에 대한 꿈을 알게 되었다.\n"
"\n"
"우리는 오크 성채에서의 끔찍한 삶에 대해 들어 왔다. 쿠로그는 내게 먼 로쓰가에서 부족의 일원으로 지냈던 젊은 날의 이야기를 해 주었다. "
"그는 젊은이 중 가장 훌륭하고 똑똑했다-또래나 대부분의 연상 오크들보다 강하고, 빠르며, 많은 점에서 더 똑똑했다. 하지만 그는 "
"부족에서의 삶에 만족하지 못했다. 그는 전투에서 자신을 증명해 보고 싶어했다. 그는 세상을 보고 싶었다. 그리고 쿠로그와 그의 부족장은 "
"알고 있었다. 만약 쿠로그가 성채에 더 오래 남아 있으면, 부족원 중 누군가가 죽을 것이라는 것을. 그것이 오크들의 삶이었다.\n"
"\n"
"문제를 일으키고 부족장에게 도전하는 대신, 쿠로그는 절친한 동료들을 모아 가스파트의 스토커 용병단에 들어가기로 했다. 해머폴과 시로딜을 "
"가로지르는 소규모 전투에서 승리를 하도록 도와준 뒤, 그 무리는 엘스웨어로 향했다. 쿠로그는 풍경들을 보고 음식을 먹고 젊은 처녀와 "
"자고(내가 아닌 그가 한 말이다.) 전투에서 연승하며 좋은 시간을 보낸 것 같았다. 나는 한 손은 쿠로그의 강력한 팔뚝을 붙잡은 채로, "
"꿀 푸딩 한 숟가락을 쿠로그에게 주었다. 그리고 아주 순수하게 물었다. \\\\\"\\\\\"하지만 앞으로의 미래는 어떡할 거에요, 내 "
"강한 친구?\\\\\"\\\\\"\n"
"\n"
"\\\\\"\\\\\"미래?\\\\\"\\\\\" 쿠로그가 웃었다. \\\\\"\\\\\"고향으로 돌아가서, 늙은 족장을 죽이고, 내 "
"부족을 지휘할 거요!\\\\\"\\\\\"\n"
"\n"
"쿠로그는 이 모든 것을 사무적으로 말했다. 그는 허풍을 떨지 않았다. 그는 내게 감명을 주려고 노력하지 않았다. 그는 단지 그가 믿는 "
"것을 내게 말한 것 뿐이었다. 그리고 그거 아는가? 나 또한 그걸 믿었다. 에머릭 왕이 지켜 보길 원하실 것은 확실히 이 오크일 것이다. "
"내 말을 명심해 둬라."

"It was in the summer of my thirteenth year that I first discovered the "
"whistle and my peculiar talent. I had long before then suspected that I had "
"within me some latent and as yet-undiscovered skill that would, in time, set "
"me apart from my peers and elevate me above them. \n"
"\n"
"As a child, I had always related poorly to people. Consequently, I was the "
"butt of many jokes and japes, especially among the bigger, stronger children."
" They had by then already begun to distinguish themselves as warriors, "
"woodcutters, and in other burly professions, while my slight build caused me "
"to lag far behind in such pursuits. But among animals I found many devoted "
"friends, and so even at my loneliest, I was rarely without companionship.\n"
"\n"
"Now, it happened that some of the older children, being, as I have "
"suggested, cruel and lording their superior strength over me, got it into "
"their heads to play a mean trick upon me. The trick involved a whistle they "
"found which produced a note that drove many creatures wild. The durzogs of "
"our homeland were especially susceptible to the sound. They took me to a "
"cave where a pack of durzogs had recently made their den and bade me to blow "
"the whistle or else they would beat me. As I have said, these children were "
"much stronger than I was and also very cruel; many times I had limped home "
"from a beating I'd received at their hands. \n"
"\n"
"But I think now that the threat of a beating would not have been enough to "
"compel me to blow the whistle, had it not also been accompanied by jeers and "
"insults that questioned my bravery. For though it was indisputable that I "
"lagged behind them in physical strength, I was determined that none could "
"outmatch me in courage or strength of spirit.\n"
"\n"
"Therefore, choosing what I knew would undoubtedly be the greater pain—though "
"not so great a pain as the shame of being branded a coward—I took the "
"whistle and blew a strong, clear note. I held the note longer than seemed "
"wise, so as to settle the question of my fearlessness once and for all. My "
"tormentors, on hearing the note, revealed their true nature and pleaded with "
"me to stop blowing the whistle. They wondered aloud whether I was crazy and "
"said that I had a death wish.\n"
"\n"
"I did not stop blowing the whistle, but held the note until I saw the "
"durzogs emerge from their lair, teeth bared and lips curled. When I stopped, "
"they stopped. For a moment, we stared at each other inquiringly. They were "
"not more than a few paces away from me. They waited, as if for a signal. I "
"put the whistle to my lips again and blew another note. The durzogs again "
"approached, but their malice did not seem to be aimed at me. In fact, they "
"seemed to implore me for instruction. I tested this theory by gesturing "
"upward as I had done many times with my dogs at home. Like the dogs, at this "
"gesture the durzogs reared on their hind legs, in unison. I tried again, "
"blowing the whistle along with the gesture for \"\"sit\"\" and \"\"lie down."
"\"\" The durzogs responded readily.\n"
"\n"
"Now the sight of this had lifted the fear from my tormentors, who now were "
"begging for a chance to use the whistle themselves. They wanted to command "
"the durzogs. I confess I took delight in refusing them, for finally I found "
"that they were envious of me and I felt that I had earned their respect. \n"
"\n"
"But the largest of them, a dimwit named Reggid, clopped me over the head and "
"took the whistle. I had barely got my senses about me (such was the force "
"with which he hit me), when I heard him blow on the whistle and registered "
"the subsequent snarls of the durzogs. As my vision cleared, I saw the "
"animals rush toward Reggid in a murderous fury. They leaped and tore at his "
"flesh, and he cried out to me, begging for me to take the whistle and call "
"the durzogs off. But I did not. \n"
"\n"
"The others looked on in horror as the beasts devoured Reggid, but at that "
"moment I felt nothing but pride. I have long held that animals can tell "
"better than we who is virtuous and who is not, and that day I felt my "
"beliefs vindicated. \n"
"\n"
"When the animals had feasted, they returned to their den to slumber. None of "
"the others dared claim the whistle, and I have kept it with me all of this "
"time. I use it in the taming and training of durzogs in many places across "
"Tamriel. Never once have I had a beast turn on me. Never once.\n"

"\n"
"I can't tell you how much I've wanted to see you again over these long years."
" I can only imagine that you've grown to be healthy and strong, I presume "
"Yazoga told you why I had to leave when you were still just a suckling babe. "
"My sanctum is not fit for a child, nor does my work allow me the luxury of "
"being a father. Yazoga has also told you by now that I am the one-and-only "
"Thukhozod—the most feared necromancer in the Wrothgarian mountains. She was "
"instructed to tell you this.\n"
"\n"
"But she only knows half the story. The truth is that I am not the one-and-"
"only Thukhozod. I am only the most recent Orc to inherit the title. My given "
"name is Khrogur and I was born to a cobbler in Wayrest. It was my great-"
"uncle who bequeathed me the title of Thukhozod, just as I now bequeath it to "
"you. \n"
"\n"
"I grow old and I know my time is short. When you become Thukhozod, these "
"Ayleid ruins will respond to you and the creatures here will serve you. "
"Those things alone will give you a life of power greater than you could ever "
"imagine, but it's the name that's the greatest treasure. When people hear "
"the name \"\"Thukhozod\"\" they quiver in terror. No one will ever cause you "
"any trouble again. \n"
"\n"
"All that's required to inherit your birthright is to mix your blood with "
"mine. I have soaked this very letter with my blood, so you must simply add a "
"drop of your own and the transformation will take place. I hope you enjoy "
"your inheritance as much as I've enjoyed mine.\n"

"I have only been in Wrothgar for a few weeks now, but I fear my hopes of "

"Yesterday, I was traversing a particularly remote area of the Wrothgarian "
"mountains when I heard the distant chirping of a blue bunting. I thought I "
"must be imagining things, but I decided I had no choice but to investigate. \n"
"\n"
"As I followed the bunting's call, I began to hear other varieties of bird "
"calls, and soon I traced the sounds to a desolate cave. Just looking into "
"the mouth of the cave, I can already see blue buntings, canaries, cardinals, "
"and even a green jay. Never before have I seen so many different birds "
"living in the same habitat.\n"
"\n"
"Tomorrow I will venture deeper into the cave. Who knows what I might find? I "
"think this might be the most excited I've been in my entire life."

"The history of the Order of the Silver Dawn stretches back to our founding "
"in 2E 428 during the werewolf crisis that plagued High Rock and was known as "
"the Curse of the Crimson Moon. Adeliza Silver-Axe established the order "
"after her beloved son, Jaron, was inflicted with the beast-curse. She was "
"forced to kill her own son to save her village. To honor his memory and to "
"provide a rallying point for the order, Adeliza wove the banner that would "
"forever represent us with thread and wool and tears. She also added a few "
"drops of her own blood to show her commitment to the cause. Every commander "
"of the order since has added a drop of his or her blood to the banner to "
"carry on the tradition.\n"
"\n"
"In time, Adeliza grew the order into a powerful force. She led the order to "
"Wrothgar, where she founded the base of operations that we call home to this "
"day. The Argent Mine, once a rich silver mine that made Adeliza's family "
"wealthy beyond compare, was turned into the secret base of the Order of the "
"Silver Dawn. We still mine silver from its depths to craft our weapons and "
"armor, and our sacred banner has a place of honor in the Purifier's Hall.\n"
"\n"
"My term as commander of the order, which began a scant six years ago, has "
"been plagued by one particular werewolf and his feral followers. Magnar "
"Child-Eater has gathered a pack of werewolves to his side. Together, they "
"rampage throughout Wrothgar and High Rock, causing mayhem, raiding and "
"marauding, and seeking new converts to their terrible, bestial tribe.\n"
"\n"
"Magnar Child-Eater, in particular, deserves a prison in the foulest corner "
"of dread Oblivion. His name isn't simply to scare the common folk. He "
"actually has a taste for the tender flesh of children, and he often rewards "
"his pack hunters for acquiring such delicacies for him to feast upon. I am "
"not exaggerating by saying that the Silver Dawn is at war with the Magnar "
"Pack. Casualties have mounted on both sides, but I have hopes that our "
"scouts are close to discovering the pack's lair. Then we can launch a final "
"assault and destroy Magnar and his feral offspring once and for all."
