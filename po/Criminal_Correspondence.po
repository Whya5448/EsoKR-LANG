"A Treatise on Conscientious Larceny\n"
"\n"
"By Zizar-dar\n"
"\n"
"To steal a thing is simplicity itself. One merely takes what one will and "
"that is that. Even a treasure jealously guarded can be stolen easily under "
"the right circumstances, but such things will not be discussed here.\n"
"\n"
"This treatise hopes the reader will become a capable pilferer of found "
"things. Methods, distractions, and tools of the trade will not be discussed "
"herein, so if you are a hungry ja'Khajiit looking to make your way on the "
"streets of Senchal, look elsewhere. (Really! What are you doing here? You "
"should be out casing marks!)\n"
"\n"
"Bandits, burglars, defalcators, and cheats—keep reading. You might learn a "
"thing or two.\n"
"\n"
"Who Is Worthy of Your Gift?\n"
"\n"
"Any able pilferer knows the next heist is merely a question of time and "
"place, but to keep your heart as light as your gloves, you would do well to "
"be wary of your target!\n"
"\n"
"Easy marks are abundant, but the majority are as desperate as you are. "
"Ignore them! You won't make a name for yourself fleecing ditch-diggers and "
"scullions of their hard-won dinners, and they certainly won't sing the songs "
"every Senchal dreg knows by heart and hair.\n"
"\n"
"No, look for the merchant whose purse lies buried behind three tall walkers "
"with etched swords and inlaid plate! Watch for the wizard whose tower sends "
"alchemical stenches billowing into the canvas city. Seek out the pomp-pursed "
"dandyclaw whose grounds are free of flicktongues.\n"
"\n"
"Never take all, just a portion! They will deem what you took an "
"\"\"acceptable loss.\"\" Admitting their loss would send every shinglestep "
"in town leaping through their casements, which is why they rarely inform the "
"guard.\n"
"\n"
"It doesn't hurt that they also have the most to pilfer. But what is worth "
"taking, and more importantly, what is there to do with all the riches you've "
"liberated from lightless prisons?\n"
"\n"
"What To Do With a Heavy Purse?\n"
"\n"
"Treasure, whether in pockets or in the ground, weighs heavily on mind and "
"the spirit.\n"
"\n"
"It can be tempting to take famous treasures. Who has not heard the many "
"tales of Rajhin? But as the tales suggest, some treasures are difficult to "
"move and are often worth more in trouble than the gold you'll get for them.\n"
"\n"
"Coin is best, of course. It's small and easy to move. Jewelry comes next, "
"though you may have to melt pieces down if they are too closely filigreed.\n"
"\n"
"Potions can be just as valuable—if not immediately useful to your trade. "
"Look especially for those with restorative properties, for these can be "
"priceless when properly plied.\n"
"\n"
"Don't overlook sundries, either! Frequently a treasure will be too well "
"guarded or trapped with snares to justify the effort, but the mark is not "
"always a lost cause. Only the most paranoid take precautions with the "
"sugarcloset, for who would impede his own sweet-tooth? Much the same with "
"the cupboards, for a hungry belly needs filling fast and tripwires only get "
"in the way.\n"
"\n"
"Do not be too prideful to make off with these things. While they will rarely "
"be missed, they can fill your belly and bring you fame to rival even the "
"luckiest moonlighters!\n"
"\n"
"Where Should You Flee?\n"
"\n"
"Take as much as you can carry! Fill your pockets and parcels with whatever "
"you can fit, such that it overflows your waistband and bites into your back! "
"Your bounty is as important to your escape as it is to your purse.\n"
"\n"
"When you are pursued —as you often will be—spoils secured properly about "
"your vitals will throw off arrows raining down from the walls.\n"
"\n"
"In the streets, cut release ties to spill out your treasures into the paths "
"of your pursuers. Throw them to the crowds! Their scrambling for your riches "
"will sow confusion, creating obstacles for your escape.\n"
"\n"
"Not only will these efforts delay your pursuers, news of your open hand will "
"spread like wildfire through the streets. What is more valuable than your "
"name? It will buy you safe haven in times of need, food for your belly in "
"lean times, and more importantly will carry you through the darkest of "
"life's troubles.\n"
"\n"
"And when you are old and can no longer leap between rooftops, you can rest "
"easily among your childrens' children, assured that your legacy is as clean "
"as a well-greased tumblecatch.\n"
"\n"
"Good luck in your exploits! When they are sung through the taverns and slums "
"of the world, Zizar-dar will be sure to carry the tune."

"\n"
"I am writing from Necrom to inform you that House Telvanni requires a very "
"specific list of new subjects for events planned in the next few months. We "
"are delighted to hear you are targeting Breton villages along the Iliac Bay "
"and we will offer significant incentive if you are able to deliver subjects "
"that fit the following criteria.\n"
"\n"
"—	Six young women, all under the age of twenty years; at least one brunette, "
"two blondes, and at least one woman of significant girth, preferably "
"extremely pale.\n"
"\n"
"—	Seven young men, all under the age of twenty-four years; hair color is "
"irrelevant, but make sure they're not too hairy. Physique is critical as at "
"least five will be used for labor. Tall and skinny would be preferred for "
"the remaining two. If one might have blue eyes, this would be preferred as "
"well.\n"
"\n"
"—	Two elderly men, but they must be healthy. We're not looking for men on "
"their deathbeds. We're looking for these men to serve as chaperones, so it's "
"also critical they have good eyesight.\n"
"\n"
"—	Lastly, any gender/age is acceptable but it's of highest necessity that we "
"get someone who has intimate knowledge of swine, as we are in desperate need "
"of a new pig-keeper. The last one was eaten.\n"
"\n"
"For any acquisition that fulfills these requests, we will offer twice the "
"normal rate. Other \"\"favors\"\" will be offered as well based on the "
"number of requests filled overall.\n"

"I wish you swift and safe sailing, Sera.\n"

"alchemist with the cruel laugh you like so much? She and I were talking the "
"other day about the way you've been running our tribe, and I gotta say, "
"Chief, her laugh sounds really cruel when she's talking about you.\n"
"\n"
"Remember that one time you led us on a raid into a cave full of Goblins? "
"Remember that? They were just a wretched band of Goblins, but you fumbled "
"the ambush, and they killed three of our best warriors. I remember the "
"screaming at their funeral. I don't remember you screaming for them, Chief.\n"
"\n"

"years of debauchery and hard living took their toll. I lost half my left ear "
"in a knife fight with a blind drunk Argonian.\n"
" \n"
"I wanted to give up, but my brother, he dreamed bigger, better.\n"
" \n"
"My brother wanted to make it to Cyrodiil and become legit merchants. We had "
"a plan. One final heist of a northbound caravan said to be filled with "
"jewels.\n"
" \n"
"Something went wrong. My brother could not stop the horses on time, and I "
"stood helplessly by and watched the wagon plummet over a cliff. But as I "
"picked through the wreckage, my devastation turned to excitement. There were "
"no jewels, but there were plenty of luxurious wolf pelts, horker tusks and "
"mammoth hides, more than enough to buy my way to Cyrodiil. I'd follow in the "
"footsteps of so many of my kind. A traveling merchant, someone with a "
"respectable profession.\n"
" \n"
"I had all the furs bundled in my pack when I saw my brother's broken body. "
"His ears were still warm, and I shut his eyes for the last time. This was "
"his dream. And he would want me to go. But what I wanted, well, the caravan "
"guards were coming. I had to go, but I couldn't just leave his body to rot.\n"
" \n"
"My brother gave me my first skin. It was to be a memento. But in the "
"darkness of the fence's cabin, the coin hit my hand heavy. Then she looked "
"at my brother's pelt and offered three times the amount of any other fur. "
"Disgust caught in my throat, but did not live very long. I realized the cost "
"of such a forbidden luxury. The value, the demand, the respect.\n"
" \n"
"This is what I wanted.\n"
" \n"
"It became easier. A dark alley, a gag in one hand and a quick slice across "
"the throat. Gently hold the body as it bleeds. I became faster, my cuts "
"precise and fluid. I peel the skin with one motion and kept the merchandise "
"pristine, in one piece.\n"
" \n"
"I became rich. Far richer than anyone in my family had ever been. Yet I was "
"careful. My stronghold was well-hidden, and practically impenetrable. I "
"hired the men that used to employ me. We moved frequently on less-traveled "
"roads when we hunted in the wild. We stalked the back alleys we used to "
"sleep in when we hunted in the city. I grew so rich that I no longer needed "
"to dirty my own hands.\n"
" \n"
"Patchwork colored furs fetched the best price among the Bosmer. Argonians "
"preferred the pelts completely skinned and tanned. Orcs prized the thick, "
"waterproof leather of the Argonians. Humans most often bought tails and ears."
" I had to employ an alchemist and a master craftsman for a couple odd "
"requests, but I didn't ask questions when the gold piled up.\n"
" \n"
"And now I'm a prisoner. Maybe I became careless. Maybe I let too many "
"secrets slip between the sheets. The raid of my fortress was a massacre. "
"They took me alive, barely. That was their mistake. My enemies should have "
"killed me when they had the chance.\n"
" \n"
"I have one lockpick. And the northern wall of my cell is weak from disrepair."
" My head shall not roll tomorrow.\n"
" \n"
"I am not finished with the trade. There will always be buyers. Someday, I "
"will sell my own skin for a king's ransom, as my name is legend. And yours "
"shall rot in the gutters with your bones.\n"

"The following is an account of the events encountered during the "
"interrogation of the witch Henghild of Wittestadr by Garmath, Witchhunter of "
"Direfrost.\n"
"\n"
"The interrogation was unremarkable for a time, and the crone had no unusual "
"reaction to the various implements of torture beyond the expected screaming "
"and pleading. It was when her blood first spilled that the manifestation "
"began.\n"
"\n"
"The witch grew suddenly still, as if in a trance. At once, a chill wind "
"filled the chamber, and the flame of the braziers turned an unearthly shade "
"of green. Echoing all about, yet seemingly coming from no discernable "
"source, all present heard a guttural, but unmistakably cogent chant, almost "
"like a religious invocation. Upon reflection, I suspect that this was the "
"language of Oblivion; the obscene tongue of the Daedric Princes. \n"
"\n"
"The iron chains that bound Henghild to the slab crumbled, impossibly, and "
"fell away. Her back arched and her eyes rolled back in her head. Slowly, her "
"body rose with no visible means of levitation, suddenly hovering several "
"feet above the slab. \n"
"\n"
"After a moment, her mouth opened and she began to speak. But it was not the "
"voice of the crone that issued forth, but rather the voice of a Daedric "
"abomination. Her words were transcribed by no fewer than three witnesses. I "
"record them here, in their entirety:\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Pain unto innocence. Screams in the dark. Nocturnal is here.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"My loyal servant is tortured and burned, bound and tormented, bereft of "
"her life.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The clan called Direfrost think themselves righteous, but Nocturnal has "
"seen their wickedness.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"My curse be upon you, and your descendants.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Your judgement will first be rendered in the form of an Ice Queen who "
"comes in the guise of a pauper.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Your blood shall be frozen. Your torment long and painful.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"And when your savior comes to release you, know that your true suffering "
"has only just begun.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"There will be a reckoning between past and present, and the name "
"Direfrost will lie in tatters before the end. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"A new Ice Queen will bring unto Direfrost all the anguish of Oblivion, "
"and you shall know true suffering.\"\" \n"
"\n"
"At this moment, the crone's body burst into green flame, and crumbled to ash."
