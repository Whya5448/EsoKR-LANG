"By Geon Alinie, Chronicler-at-Large\n"
"\n"
"My in-depth investigation of the clandestine organization known only as the "
"Dark Brotherhood has been a long and difficult process. But after years of "
"research, countless interviews, and no small amount of good luck, I've "
"finally been able to put together a profile of the assassin cult's ruling "
"body—the notorious Black Hand. While much of what follows has been augmented "
"by theory and conjecture, the basis upon which I constructed the profile is "
"undeniably factual and true.\n"
"\n"
"So, what group of individuals is strong enough to command the assassins of "
"the Dark Brotherhood? A group called the Black Hand. Like any hand, the "
"group consists of five members: four fingers and a thumb, as it were. The "
"members corresponding to the fingers are called the Speakers, while the "
"member representing the thumb is called the Listener. These are titles and "
"ranks, and as ridiculous as they may sound to anyone not steeped in the lore "
"of the cult, the assassins take these terms very seriously.\n"
"\n"
"Now, I need to explain an even stranger concept. It will sound unbelievable, "
"and it may very well be nothing but a legend used to keep the lesser "
"assassins in line, but from everything I've been able to uncover, the cult "
"holds fast to this concept. They claim that a near-deific figure known as "
"either the Shadow Matriarch, the Dark Woman, or the Night Mother leads the "
"Dark Brotherhood. Apparently, no one ever sees this Dark Woman. Instead, she "
"whispers commands to the Listener, who then selects one of the Speakers to "
"pass the commands along. And, yes, most of these commands relate to murder.\n"
"\n"
"What does the Listener hear? Details, as you can imagine, are sketchy, but "
"an educated guess allows us to assume that the Dark Woman provides either "
"the name of the client or the target that has been named for the kill. The "
"Listener passes this information on to one of the Speakers, who then either "
"personally selects an assassin to carry out the deed or provides the "
"information to a minor functionary to assign the contract.\n"
"\n"
"Now, as far as I can tell, the assassins don't all gather in one place. "
"Instead, the cult divides its members into small, self-sufficient units "
"known as either Havens, Sanctuaries, Shelters, or Assassin Ports. Again, "
"details on these topics are often fluid and even contradictory, but I have "
"done my best to make sense of the stillness within the noise. The leader of "
"these Havens, which seem to be established in specific geographic locations "
"as to spread the assassin's reach far and wide, is either called a Dame or a "
"Matron (although one source referred to her as a Widow, but the other names "
"were much more common in my research). The Speaker can pass along orders to "
"this subordinate and have her select the assassin best-suited to carry out "
"the deed.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, I was able to ascertain that each Speaker commands a personal "
"assassin. For truly special missions, I can only assume. I'm not sure if "
"these personal assassins are considered wrists or knuckles or some other "
"body part, but I did learn that they are possibly granted the title of "
"Quieter, or maybe Husher, or even Silencer. Something menacing and "
"ridiculous like that. These are supposedly the best of the best, master "
"killers without peer. Whether they constitute as members of the Black Hand "
"or not, I was never able to determine, nor did I come across information "
"concerning how they receive their orders.\n"
"\n"
"The Dark Brotherhood. The Black Hand. Melodramatic names for a demented cult "
"of killers—but they are killers, all the same."

"Dearest Uncle,\n"
"\n"
"I'm not sure why I continue to write to you. I know you're gone. That you "
"can't read my words and respond in kind. I certainly never send the letters. "
"In fact, the box I keep them in is nearly full. Whatever the reason, writing "
"my thoughts as though I'm talking to you calms me and helps me think through "
"the problems of the day. And, oh, dear Uncle, do we have problems!\n"
"\n"
"I've told you at length about the vile and hateful Fortunata ap Dugal. Damn "
"the woman, but she's a pox upon the Gold Coast! It's all I can do to keep "
"her greedy claws from snatching Kvatch and devouring it whole. She's already "
"ruined Anvil. I refuse to allow her to do the same thing here. And, I "
"suppose, that's the reason for our latest correspondence. I just wish that I "
"could benefit one more time from your wisdom and experience.\n"
"\n"
"I have decided to appeal to the lesser of two evils in order to save our "
"beloved city. I never expected to consider the Dark Brotherhood to be a "
"lesser evil, but that's the times we're living in. I've gathered all of the "
"components necessary to conduct the foul ritual. I'm not looking forward to "
"performing this gruesome ceremony, but I know of no other way to employ the "
"services of these assassins. Uncle, do not be disappointed in me. I can "
"truly claim that Fortunata has left me no alternative.\n"
"\n"
"With any luck, the next time I write to you, it will be to tell you that "
"Kvatch is safe again. I miss you, Uncle, every day.\n"

"Your Excellence, the Grand Chanter,\n"
"\n"
"I must ask again, when can I be reassigned to the Kvatch Cathedral? The "
"shrine devoted to Akatosh here in the Chapel of Dibella is fine, but I must "
"admit to a sense of discomfort among all these Dibella followers. One of the "
"Eight Divines is as great as the next, of course, but my heart and soul "
"longs to be in the presence of the Dragon God's grand palace in Kvatch. "
"Besides, there are so many heathen pirates in Anvil. How the other priests "
"of the Divines stand them is beyond my capacity for rational thought.\n"
"\n"
"I know! If I can aid in the efforts against the Shadows That We Hate, would "
"that earn me a position at the Cathedral? There's that little Nord woman I "
"mentioned in my last two letters. She has opened up to me about topics that "
"would make your blood run cold, your Excellence. Perhaps I can use some of "
"what she confided in me to weaken the Shadows and perhaps even throw them "
"into some confusion. Yes, I'll make sure that the next time we speak, I "
"strongly suggest a course of action that will separate her from her pack. I "
"may even have a use for those Silver Dawn fanatics.\n"
"\n"
"I await the good news that you have finally found a place for me in the "
"Cathedral.\n"

"Efforts continue according to the plan. After a few false starts, our agent "

"finally expired. No matter. I'm sure the Black Dragon will secure another "
"specimen before long.\n"
"\n"
"Strange. Something has disturbed the murderer's corpse in the interrogation "
"hall. Maybe Akatosh has answered my prayer and sent another murderer for me "
"to question. Well, I wouldn't want to keep whoever it is waiting."

"I sought out the ruins of Knightsgrave after the Enclave of the Hourglass "
"began to feel too confining, too full of life. I don't deserve to mingle "

"\n"

"I admired the statues on the stairs that descended into these ruins. The "

"There must be another way to gain entry into the ruins. How else have these "
"minotaurs made their way down here? I had to kill one of the proud beasts "
"when it surprised me. After that, I took great pains to avoid the creatures. "
"After all, no one has ordered me to murder them. And, I suppose, they serve "
"as guardians of a sort. Why not allow them to continue in that role?\n"

"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I spent a long time praying in the circle of pillars known as the Paragon's "
"Crown. Maybe Akatosh heard my plea, for I soon discovered a tunnel into an "
"even more ancient portion of the ruins. It appears that the Order built "
"their original home atop an ancient cave that harkens back to a more ancient "
"time. An impressive and, dare I say it, frightening statue of Akatosh "
"dominates the cave. I can only assume that this place owes its existence to "
"the Alessian Order and their efforts to raise Akatosh above all other gods. "
"Even the scattered cages hint at darker rites than those practiced by "
"Primate Artorius and his ilk in the Cathedral of Kvatch.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"The Primate, the Order, the Brotherhood—damn them all for turning me into "
"what I've become! Perhaps down here, in the shadow of Akatosh's most "
"fearsome presence, I'll finally discover who I'm truly meant to be."

"Soldiers came to the farm last night. They were in the Duke's livery. My "

"Matron Astara asked me to collect a few thoughts and salient facts about the "

"whom we might have to deal with at some point in the future. Now, that "
"doesn't mean we have to kill these people. We might have to work with them, "
"or request a favor, or—no, we'll probably have to kill them. That's usually "
"what we do.\n"
"\n"
"Provincial Governor Fortunata ap Dugal: The one-time Pirate Queen started "
"out as a minor functionary in the Gold Coast Trading Company before her "
"skills and ambitions earned her a place among the merchant lords at the top "
"of the organization. But that wasn't enough for Fortunata. She set sail for "
"an extended trade mission. When she returned, she was at the head of an "
"armada of pirate vessels as the wildly popular queen of the Red Sails "
"pirates. She easily seized control of Anvil and proclaimed herself the "
"Provincial Governor of the city. Now Fortunata rules Anvil with an iron fist "
"wrapped in a velvet glove. No one dares challenge her due to her own strong "
"personality and demonstrated fighting skills, and because there are always "
"at least a dozen heavily armed pirates at her beck and call. Not to mention "
"her personal Rat Master, who brings her secrets like a lover brings gifts. "
"Her ambitions exceed the borders of the port city, however, and she has "
"already declared that the entire Gold Coast is under her control. That's not "
"quite true, but it appears that it soon will be.\n"
"\n"
"Count Carolus Aquilarios: The Wolf of Kvatch is the nephew of Varen "
"Aquilarios. He's served his city and defended it ever since Varen marched "
"off to war. He may be the only truly good person among the movers and "
"shakers of the Gold Coast. He's a man of faith and conviction, honorable and "
"proud of his heritage. I also find him to be extremely dull. He doesn't like "
"Fortunata, though, and has so far been able to keep her pirates out of "
"Kvatch. He has an uneasy alliance with the Cathedral of Akatosh, which "
"dominates not only his city's skyline but serves as its spiritual conscience "
"as well. In fact, he recently granted the Cathedral's protectors, the Order "
"of the Hour, expanded rights and duties to supplement the efforts of the "
"Kvatch Guard. He could prove to be a powerful opponent of the Brotherhood—if "
"he weren't mired in the politics of just keeping his city safe from those "
"who would like to carve it up like a festival goose.\n"
"\n"
"Primate Artorius Ponticus: The head of the Akatosh faith and the leader of "
"the Great Cathedral, presents an interesting and complicated man. He "
"practically burns with religious fervor and truly believes that Akatosh "
"guides and supports his efforts. He's also as ambitious in his own way as "
"Fortunata, as demonstrated by his swift rise through the religious hierarchy."
" For a religious man, he has a surprisingly vast network of spies and "
"informants hidden throughout the Gold Coast. It's exceedingly rare for "
"something to happen that the Primate doesn't know about. He is supported by "
"Grand Chanter Surus and Grand Sermonizer Fithia, as well as the warrior-"
"priests of the Order of the Hour. If Artorius were ever to turn his faithful "
"followers against us, they might be powerful enough to threaten the "
"Brotherhood. Not that I think that scenario is likely.\n"
"\n"
"Other notables include Lord Quintus Jarol, Commander Marcus Scipio of the "
"Order of the Hour, Lord Harthaw Brent of the Gold Coast Trading Company, and "
"a visitor to our lands who thought to go unnoticed, Razum-dar of the Queen's "
"Eyes. Reports on these potential threats, targets, or allies will be on your "
"desk shortly."

"Legend has it that in the early days of Cyrodiil, in the wake of the "
"Alessian Doctrines, there were three lords that formed a regency council "
"over the Kingdom of Kvatch. The name of that king and two of the lords are "
"lost to history. Lord Faleria's name, however, is whispered in the night as "
"a cautionary tale of how far one would go to protect those they love. \n"
"\n"
"As a young man, Lord Faleria secretly, and to the shame of his family, fell "
"in love with an Elven scholar, wise in the ways of dark magic and necromancy."
" The Nenalata Ayleids swore fealty to the Empire, but their people were "
"still an unwelcome sight in polite society. Together, they pored over lost "
"secrets, hoping to find a way to be together always. They married in secret "
"and enjoyed a few short years of happiness, which ended with an Imperial "
"decree.\n"
"\n"
"To hide his wife from the purge, Lord Faleria expanded his fortress into the "
"underground tunnels beneath the structure. They enlarged the space with "
"magic, the sweat of hired workers, and the help of a tribe of minotaurs. It "
"was to be a grand underground complex to match those of his wife's Ayleid "
"ancestors, and equally as brutal. \n"
"\n"
"As each wing was completed, they secretly had the workers put to death. Some "
"were buried. Some had the life drawn out of them to extend the lives of Lord "
"Faleria and his wife. Of these, some were raised as undead guardians. After "
"all, Lord Faleria could not allow rumors and secrets to get out, and dead "
"guardians spread no tales. \n"
"\n"
"As the complex grew, so did Lord Faleria's family. He swore to do anything "
"to protect his children—these Elven children—from death or banishment at the "
"hands of the Empire. It was during the birth of their third child that Lady "
"Faleria died. In mourning, his lordship erected a great brass tomb in the "
"tunnels, sealing his love away and promising to do anything to protect her "
"children from the religious zealots of the Empire.\n"
"\n"
"At this time, Lord Faleria delved deeper into the study of dark arts, "
"formulating wicked magic fueled by a darkness from some far realm that "
"consumed all things good and light. He learned to channel the power and "
"found it all but limitless.\n"
"\n"
"Lord Faleria edged closer and closer to madness after the death of his Elven "
"wife, though he could never explain his troubles to his peers in the outside "
"world. To keep his Elven family a secret, he continued to use disposable "
"labor to expand their realm and give them new comforts.\n"
"\n"
"The children grew into adults, rarely seeing sunlight. Well into adulthood, "
"his youngest son could not take his confinement any longer. He managed to "
"escape, and did so easily and often. Inevitably, as these things happen, the "
"son fell in love with a merchant's daughter. Soon, she was with child. The "
"girl's family, horrified at the child's Elven traits, forced the young woman "
"to confess that her lover was Lord Faleria's son. Horrified at being "
"discovered, Lord Faleria took his grandson and hid him with the rest of the "
"family.\n"
"\n"
"The Empire was at his gate within days, with charges ranging from treason to "
"giving aid to the enemy. For these crimes against the Empire, he had no "
"defense. But he had prepared a response for this day. In his madness, Lord "
"Faleria performed a dark ritual. If he could not be with his family, he "
"would rather destroy everything he created—and the Imperial Army along with "
"it. \n"
"\n"
"The night came. The ritual concluded. It would take only one final gesture "
"to consume the entire castle in eternal darkness. At the final moment, a "
"hand fell upon his shoulder. His son was behind him, standing with the rest "
"of the family.\n"
"\n"
"It was too late. The very shadows crawled like smoke from the ground, "
"dissolving objects, walls, men, and mer. Some formed man-like shapes and "
"attacked the besieging army from within. Others opened up like rifts, and "
"the world fell inside them.\n"
"\n"
"When it was over, only Lord Faleria remained amid the freshly made ruins. As "
"the legends say, he buried his children and grandchild on the surface, where "
"he never allowed them to go. Then he retreated into the hole in the ground, "
"sealing it behind him.\n"
"\n"
"For most great men, the walls and monuments survive far longer than their "
"name. For Lord Faleria, the location of his fort is lost to time, but his "
"name remains."

"For as long as Anvil has stood upon the Gold Coast, it has been a city of "
"adventure and allure. Legend and mysteries abound, filling its streets and "
"taverns with tales from all around the world. One of these stories doesn't "
"originate in some far-off land. Anvil has its own incarnation of the city's "
"beauty and charm, hewn from stone older than any lain in the building "
"foundations—the Mermaid of Anvil.\n"
"\n"
"With no inscription decorating its base and no certificate of origin stored "
"in the city records, the Mermaid remains a blank canvas upon which locals "
"and visitors alike have painted their own picture. Her carefree repose and "
"immodest attitude have earned her a multitude of names and titles—some of "
"which are not suitable to be printed here. Whether you know her as the "
"wistful Brine Maiden, the Leggy Lass, the Salty Serenader, the Stone "
"Seductress, or a hundred other monikers, the Mermaid of Anvil never fails to "
"leave a lasting impression on all who gaze upon her.\n"
"\n"
"What about the Mermaid so manages to enthrall us? The gentle curves of pale "
"rock create a fancy figure, certainly, but was she laid bare for the sake of "
"art? The sheer scale of her grandeur rivals many statues erected to the "
"Divines, the royals of Tamriel, or the Daedric Princes themselves, leading "
"some to speculate that the Mermaid was once a figure of similar stature to "
"her unknown creators. Could our fair Mermaid actually be a long forgotten "
"god or an unrecognized aspect of one of the Divines? Certainly the more "
"scandalizing rumors suggest she might be Azura as she appeared to some "
"ancient sea-dwelling civilization, but it's hard to imagine the Sload being "
"capable of making something of such beauty. And what does that leave? The "
"dreugh? No, more believable to imagine that Sea Elves once had scales and "
"gills.\n"
"\n"
"We know so little about who or what the Mermaid truly represents, and even "
"less about who may or may not have created her. There's no credible record "
"of who painstakingly carved and polished the great stone that gave birth to "
"our patron beauty. Many have attempted to explain the origin of the Mermaid, "
"or even assert that some long lost ancestor was responsible for her design. "
"No matter how reputable the source, however, further investigation always "
"reveals the statue to predate any such claims. In fact, the most recent "
"archaeological study indicates that the Mermaid easily pre-dates any "
"structure in Anvil, indicating that at least a few of her admirers were so "
"taken with her as to set down roots in her shadow and build the city around "

"A Fighters Guild Tract\n"
"Compiled by the Anvil Fighters Guild\n"
"\n"
"As a service to the public interest, the Fighters Guild seeks to educate all "
"denizens of Tamriel about common threats. This tract discusses the goblin "
"tribes of the Gold Coast, and is presented by the Anvil Fighters Guild.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"Hall Steward <<1>>,\n"
"\n"
"Per the terms of my punishment detail, I elected to provide you with this "
"essay regarding the goblin tribes found in the Gold Coast. By your estimate "
"it should have taken me little more than a day's work. It is with great "
"frustration that I deliver this to you a week late.\n"
"\n"
"The Sharp Stick tribe claims the southern portion of the Gold Coast as their "
"territory, while the Long Tooth tribe claims the northern. What more is "
"there to say about goblins in the Gold Coast?\n"
"\n"
"Much, I discovered, and most of it confusing.\n"
"\n"
"I first thought the Long Tooth tribe was the oldest goblin tribe in the "
"region, but they are actually a recent arrival. They used to be three tribes:"
" the Long Claws, Tooth Rocks, and Rock Sticks. The Long Claws and Tooth "
"Rocks once fought constantly over hunting grounds southwest of Chorrol. "
"Shortly after the Chorrol Fighters Guild took a contract to drive them from "
"the area, they both fled.\n"
"\n"
"The tribes harassed each other during their migration to the Gold Coast "
"until they stumbled across the mostly insular but populous Rock Sticks. "
"Presented with a common enemy, Long Claw and Tooth Rocks banded together to "
"slay every Rock Stick who opposed them.\n"
"\n"
"Within the month, the remaining goblins began to call themselves Long Tooth "
"tribe. They erected crude banners, effectively claiming the lands north of "
"Anvil as their territory. I don't know why. The Long Tooth aren't exactly "
"talking.\n"
"\n"
"As for the Sharp Stick tribe, they are a mishmash of several former goblin "
"tribes. The Eye Sticks fought the Sharp Rocks, who tricked the Shatter Bones "
"into attacking the Blood Skulls. However, the mortal enemies of the Blood "
"Skulls were the Gut Blades, who ambushed Shatter Bones and Blood Skull alike."
" \n"
"\n"
"When the Sharp Rocks and Eye Sticks saw the three-sided battle among rival "
"tribes, they briefly allied to conquer the others. On the eve of their "
"victory, Eye Sticks and Sharp Rocks turned on one another. This great battle "
"took place in the southern region of the Gold Coast, to the complete "
"ignorance of all but a hapless Khajiit trapper who happened upon them. (He "
"is credited with the popular Kvatch tavern song, \"\"The War That Never Was."
"\"\")\n"
"\n"
"There were survivors among the five warring tribes. Some fled and became the "
"Rock Sticks who were (years later) subjugated by the Long Claws and Tooth "
"Rocks. Those who remained became the Sharp Sticks, fortifying themselves "
"against reprisal attacks from the Rock Sticks which never came. They "
"eventually turned to a life of farming and kept to themselves.\n"
"\n"
"With the Long Tooth and Sharp Stick so close to each other, it is only a "
"matter of time before they clash. If we end up with one big goblin tribe "
"called the Long Sticks, my only request is you put me on the contract to "
"drive them out of the Gold Coast.\n"

"Of all the tools available to an assassin, one weapon truly stands out as "
"unique to the Brothers and Sisters of the Dark Brotherhood. Known as the "
"Blade of Woe (and, obliquely, as the Night Mother's Kiss) the otherwise "
"simple dagger is a symbol of their order and icon of their dark patrons. The "
"dagger, named for the apocryphal blade wielded by the Night Mother when she "
"supposedly sacrificed her own children, is made available to the devotees of "
"the Dark Brotherhood to carry out their grisly work. I have heard "
"conflicting reports that the entire Brotherhood somehow shares a single "
"blade and that each individual weapon is crafted upon the pattern of the "
"original. I suspect the latter is closer to the truth than the former, but "
"the legend persists.\n"
"\n"
"The Blade of Woe, sacred to the Dark Brotherhood's patron deity, the Dread "
"Father Sithis, supposedly contains a special power to send the souls of "
"those it kills directly to the Void. My own studies of similar artifacts "
"have found no evidence of any such magicka. It's possible only a follower of "
"Sithis can invoke these alleged properties, but I find it more likely that "
"the blade simply holds special religious significance to its wielder, but no "
"practical application in these regards. And since the victims of the Dark "
"Brotherhood meet their ends in every way imaginable, including by poison and "
"sabotage, they must believe, at least, that every death they inflict somehow "
"finds its way to Sithis. \n"
"\n"
"Given the secretive nature of the Dark Brotherhood, acquiring information is "
"all but impossible and research on the subject is suspect at best and "
"extremely hard to come by. I hope that by bringing this topic out into the "
"open, other diligent scholars will investigate these mysterious killers and "
"help to remove the shroud of mystery that surrounds their beliefs and act \n"

"Abah's Landing is like most cities. The poor and witless cannot survive long."
" Luckily, this one is not witless. Many days I scouted the city, searching "
"for means to rebuild my fortunes. An inattentive, overconfident merchant "
"would serve nicely. I, Zabia-ko, found one at the Spotless Goods Shipping "
"Concern.\n"
"\n"
"Through hard work, soon this one could afford a cart, a guar (named Little "
"Bazrag, for his stubbornness), passage to the Gold Coast, and some crates of "
"exotics to trade. Zabia-ko's promise to her father would be met! She would "
"return to her childhood village, pockets fat with gold, sacks of coffee, and "
"bags of Mistral moon-sugar, prized for its fruity aftertaste.\n"
"\n"
"But tragedy befell Zabia-ko on the road from Anvil to Kvatch. After selling "
"a sleeve of horker summer sausage to workers at a dig site, they invited her "
"to rest for the night at the edge of their camp.\n"
"\n"
"Sleep could not have held this one long when the ground shook, followed by "
"much shouting. The workers scattered, running every direction like field "
"mice during a game of This One Caught Many. Little Bazrag refused to wake, "
"so Zabia-ko hid.\n"
"\n"
"That's when we saw them. Tiny creatures, no taller than the lip of this "
"one's boot, with buzzing wings. As they chased one of the workers from his "
"bedroll, he shrieked \"\"nixad!\"\" before plummeting over the lip and "
"breaking his leg. The little beasts giggled and taunted him as he moaned in "
"pain.\n"
"\n"
"Nearby, Zabia-ko heard high-pitched grunting. She spotted one with a pouch "
"of gold hanging from its sharp claws. It did not seem that it should fly "
"under such weight, but its wings flapped furiously, successfully fleeing "
"with its prize. The other raised its arms over its head, ready to strike at "
"a bag of the Mistral moon-sugar. It dove in headfirst, legs and wings "
"protruding from the bag, as it happily ate its weight.\n"
"\n"
"This one grabbed the thief by the legs and pulled it from the sack. It "
"thumped my head and giggled wickedly. As it buzzed away, it left a trail of "
"sugar in its wake. This one gave chase, but lost it in the darkness. During "
"the struggle, Zabia-ko failed to notice the other nixad plunge face-first in "
"the moon-sugar bags.\n"
"\n"
"By the time she returned, Zabia-ko found empty sacks. All that remained were "
"three dead nixad inside, overstuffed with moon-sugar. Even Little Bazrag had "
"wandered off.\n"
"\n"
"Once more I lost my goods! Prized Mistral moon-sugar—such a loss, wasted on "
"filthy, wicked creatures. As for the coffee? Completely untouched.\n"
"\n"
"Zabia-ko learned much that night. First: should you lose your Mistral moon-"
"sugar to nixad, roast them afterward. Their sweetened meat leaves a "
"tingling, fruity aftertaste on the tongue.\n"
"\n"
"Second: When traveling through nixad-infested lands, surround your moon-"
"sugar with bags of coffee. The bitter scent should drive them away, making "
"your journey all the sweeter."

"Pirates pose a common problem to most merchants who ply their trade by the "
"sea. But if you asked anyone other than a sailor to name even one crew "
"responsible for their nautical woes, I wager you'd find them woefully at a "
"loss. Few of these outlaws ever achieve the heights of infamy needed to "
"reach the ears of inland folk. The Red Sails and their Pirate Queen, "
"Fortunata ap Dugal, stand as the notable exception to this rule. Their "
"notoriety stretches all along the Abecean Coast, to the point of being a "
"household name and catchall bugaboo among residents of waterside towns. This "
"widespread reputation is a relatively recent development.\n"
"\n"
"Not all that long ago, the Red Sails were much more like their "
"contemporaries—independent and unremarkable. Originally a band of raiders "
"plundering a meager living along the Strid River, it was the arrival of "
"Fortunata ap Dugal that marked the beginning of a new era for the humble "
"raiders who would soon be known as the Red Sails. Using her position in the "
"Gold Coast Trading Company to lure the raiders to her side, she soon began "
"building her floating armada.\n"
"\n"
"Under Fortunata's ambitious—some would say fearless—leadership, the raiders "
"made their first voyage out to the Abecean Sea. In what can only be "
"described as a suicidal assault, her smaller complement of raiders scaled a "
"larger pirate vessel. Its captain considered the smaller river boat beneath "
"his notice and made the mistake of ignoring its approach. With cunning and "
"brutality, Fortunata and her crew seized the captain and forced his "
"surrender. Offering to accept the oath of any of the enemy crew who would "
"serve her as captain, she ordered the former captain and his officers strung "
"up on the rigging and slaughtered the lot of them. With the blood of her "
"rivals still seeping into the cloth, Fortunata raised the sails that would "
"be her crew's calling card for years to come.\n"
"\n"
"Using her connections as a merchant lord and the growing power of her Red "
"Sails pirates, Fortunata turned a band of lawless miscreants into a feudal "
"hierarchy of lords and vassals in the form of ship captains and their crews. "
"After a number of successful boarding actions that resulted in the capture "
"of pirate and merchant vessels alike, more and more captains began to "
"voluntarily flock to her banner. The fearsome reputation of the Pirate Queen "
"and her Red Sails spread like wildfire from port to port as the harrowing "
"tales of their attacks became the main topic of discussion in smoky taverns "
"and crowded inns.\n"
"\n"
"When the time was right, Fortunata and her armada sailed into Anvil Harbor "
"and grabbed control of the city. Now Provincial Governor Fortunata and her "
"Red Sails enforcers claim the entire Gold Coast as their personal domain. "
"It's estimated that the Red Sails have more than two dozen vessels under the "
"blood-red sabers on a white banner. A navy in its own right, the Pirate "
"Queen could lay claim to any port she desired. And without the Imperial Navy "
"to oppose her, it's just a matter of time before she sets her sights beyond "
"the Gold Coast. Anyone who thinks the Red Sails have reached the pinnacle of "
"their ambition is simply living in denial.\n"

"포르투나타의 야심 찬 지도 하에—어떤 이들은 두려움이 없는 지도라고 말할 지도 모른다—, 도적들은 아비시안 해로 첫 번째 항해를 했다. "

"forming a phalanx of shields and casting lightning and storms, Mighty Flicka "
"and the rest were past them, meeting us at the shore. The Wereshark had "

"\n"
"Caught between a crowd of the most ruthless buccaneers to ever raise a sail "

"like a moon blossom in Sentinel's heat. Eventually, the surviving Maormer "
"scattered and fled into the woods, chased by most of the lizard bulls. With "
"Neramo and Vimy to show the others how it was done, we took down what few "
"lizard bulls challenged us.\n"
"\n"
"After quickly looting every valuable we could from the Elf corpses, we "
"survivors rushed into our boats and pushed out onto open sea. All of us kept "
"wary eyes on the anchored Sea Elf galleon floating beyond the Pale Spirit. "
"New fog rolled in behind us, and I'll never forget the tortured cries of "
"those Sea Elves as the lizard bulls chased them down and gored them. Despite "
"their barbarous ways, I almost pitied the poor bastards as the island's "
"terrifying inhabitants slaughtered them to the last.\n"
"\n"
"Captain Wereshark now wore the golden-armored leader's helmet on his own "
"head, though that was more of a mocking joke than a permanent adjustment. As "

"colored feathers! How then would people recognize him?\n"
"\n"
"As we rowed, and Sea Elves screamed, we waited for lightning, or storms, or "

"aboard as the surviving crew of the Silver Arrow did the same. We set sail, "
"but the Sea Elf warship stayed where it was anchored. I knew then that fool "
"of a Sea Elf captain had not left enough sailors on board to sail his "
"warship home. On another day we might have seized her, but we had neither "
"the necessary crew to sail her nor a benefactor who would buy her.\n"
"\n"
"I watched the fog swallow that Sea Elf warship and the island of enraged "
"lizard bulls. The screams persisted long after both had vanished from view, "

"flapping of the Pale Spirit's mighty sails. We sailed with the Silver Arrow "
"all through the night, in case there were more Sea Elf warships in search of "

"all it could do was roar and swing its trident as Neramo set it once more "
"aflame.\n"
"\n"
"With a fierce cry, the Wereshark called us to action. He and the Snowclaw "
"twins fell upon the beast with axe and blade as I called down spells to aid "
"and heal them from afar. Blinded, burning, and exhausted, the beast fell, "
"but not before a blind swing tossed Baldor Snowclaw across the beach. "
"Fortunately, the blow only hit his head, the hardest part of a Nord, and I "
"ensured he didn't bleed for all that long.\n"
"\n"
"Beast dealt with, the Wereshark ordered us to search the huts one last time. "
"We found absolutely nothing of value, just those egg shell fragments, and so "
"the Wereshark wisely ordered us back to the boats. The growling hadn't "
"stopped, which meant more massive lizard bulls lumbered through the trees.\n"
"\n"
"An island filled with empty huts and lizard bulls was not the place to risk "
"our lives. There were other pearls to be clutched. We returned to the beach "
"to await the others, and when we reached it, we found an army of glistening "
"Sea Elves. They surrounded our boats and had Hard-Scales, Bugnose, and the "
"Cliff Racer survivors hostage. I learned later the cat-hating bastards "
"gutted One-Eyed Bahzi for sport.\n"
"\n"
"Cloaked from view, the Wereshark took our counsel. We couldn't leave Hard-"
"Scales and Bugnose in chains, and besides, the Sea Elves had our ships. A "
"Maormer warship was just visible anchored between the Pale Spirit, the "
"Silver Arrow, and open sea, which would hinder our escape even if we did "
"manage to somehow return to them. After a moment of consideration, the "
"Wereshark made his decision. We would \"\"negotiate.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"He ordered us to wait in the shadows and to attack only if he shouted "
"\"\"Stendarr's Blood!\"\" Understand, dear reader, we are pirates, and all "
"pirates know the fate of one taken by Sea Elves. Any of us would gladly "
"embrace a death gutting those knife-ears over being carved up as a storm "
"sacrifice. If the Sea Elves refused to negotiate, the Wereshark promised, "
"more than a few of them would be floating home.\n"
"\n"
"The moment the Wereshark announced himself, over four dozen Sea Elves drew "
"blades and bows and turned to him, milky eyes wide, but my captain sauntered "
"toward them as if strolling down any crowded street in Abah's Landing. He "
"kept his hands visible and away from his sword hilts, and the Sea Elves let "
"him come. No doubt Hard-Scales had told them of our captain's many exploits, "
"as instructed.\n"
"\n"
"When they moved to disarm him, the Wereshark made no protest as they removed "
"his swords, and then the daggers from his boots, and the dagger from his "
"belt, and those up his sleeves. That was when the slimmest of the Sea Elves, "
"a pale-faced fool in golden armor that glinted in the sun, approached my "
"captain and backhanded him across the face. The Wereshark spit at his feet "
"and grinned wide.\n"
"\n"
"I glanced at Vimy, who rolled her eyes. Not a good start to the negotiations."
" Mighty Flicka chose that moment to charge from the forest with her Nords, "
"all howling like a pack of enraged welwas.\n"
"\n"
"Eight trident-swinging lizard bulls rushed the beach after them, chased by a "
"gleeful Galena Two-Scars."

"The Pyandonea Expedition, Continued\n"
"\n"
"It was only after the crew finished dragging the boats ashore that it "
"started. Irregular growling and snorting peppered with ear-splitting snaps "
"of breaking wood, like a wild boar rutting on a bed of rotted timbers. It "
"came from somewhere in the thick cluster of skinny trees that crept up on "
"the white sand beach.\n"
"\n"
"Any other captain would have had us back on the boats and out to the Pale "
"Spirit before you could gather enough spit to fill a thimble, but the "
"Wereshark's a different sort. He called us all to order on the white-sand "
"beach, his booming growl forming sailors up as pretty as a military "
"procession. The first sailor to gut whatever beast made that teeth-grinding "
"racket, the Wereshark proclaimed, would get his pick of plundered items from "
"the expedition, as well as a welwa steak dinner in the Wereshark's personal "
"cabin.\n"
"\n"
"Just like that, the crew went from worried to eager, for battle and "
"everything else. If you've never had welwa steak, dear reader, know there's "
"nothing better. The way Bagroga salts and cooks it, it tastes like beef and "
"salted cheese and slides down your gullet like greased plantains. No man who "
"sails with the Wereshark can smell it without their mouth watering, and I'll "
"admit, even my own stomach grumbled its assent.\n"
"\n"
"The Wereshark broke us into groups. Hard-Scales would lead a party "
"consisting of Bugnose, One-Eyed Bahzi, and five sailors from the Cliff Racer "
"along the beach, in case the forest beasts ventured out to the sea or there "
"was habitation to be found and looted. Mighty Flicka would lead the tribe of "
"Nord axe swingers, who signed on with us at the Starving Dog, east into the "
"forest to kill or flush whatever was making that rhythmic growl, with Galena "
"Two-Scars along to scout. Never did I see a Wood Elf happier to see trees.\n"
"\n"
"The Wereshark chose to lead the last group himself. That including his loyal "
"first mate (yours truly), the Snowclaw twins, Vimy Lacroix, and the exiled "
"High Elf Neramo. We were to scout the rocky shoals to the south of our "
"landing position and circle around to Hard-Scales's group. We were a smaller "
"party than the rest, but I've never met a knife-ear better at making people "
"explode than Neramo the Mad Mage.\n"
"\n"
"The shoals were treacherous but empty, and we trekked for almost an hour, "
"listening to that horrible growling, before we came across a bunch of empty "
"huts made out of sticks, mud, and leaves. No one was home and there was "
"nothing in the homes but giant egg shell fragments, but it confirmed the "
"island was inhabited, or had been, until whatever was in that forest got "
"hungry and came out on the beach.\n"
"\n"
"The growling came and went, teeth-grinding as ever, but we'd heard no "
"screaming or shouts of terror from the other parties. That meant whatever it "
"was, Mighty Flicka hadn't found it yet. I almost pitied whatever was making "
"the racket until it stepped out onto the beach and stared at us, a four "
"legged lizard bull twice as tall as Bugnose. The thing had green scales and, "
"I swear by Mara's skirts, a glittering trident shiny as one you'd see "
"carried by some stuffy Altmer Queensguard on the streets of Auridon.\n"
"\n"
"Needless to say, no one objected when Neramo hit it in the face with a "
"fireball."

"The Pyandonea Expedition\n"
"\n"
"With our debts settled, we bid goodbye to Gnarlnose and Steggofins, left the "
"frozen shores of Skyrim, and set sail laden with treasures twice as heavy as "
"all the brave sailors we lost. The Pale Spirit was so laden with Nordic "
"booty she plowed through the sea like a harbor seal, but we made port "
"without so much as a sailor overboard. Unknown to us, our next expedition "
"would be our most dangerous yet.\n"
"\n"
"We reached the port in Wayrest, and it took only a few days before Captain "
"Wereshark made the acquaintance of Duke Gignac, the aging Breton adventurer. "
"He purchased many of our Nordic relics and, impressed by my captain's "
"legendary charisma (and, more importantly, the urging of his oldest "
"daughter, Lucette) my captain suckered the old man into funding the Pale "
"Spirit's next expedition to the Maormer islands of Pyandonea. Wearing a new "
"red feather from Lucette in his crown, the Wereshark returned us to sea.\n"
"\n"
"Our stated purpose was to do what we could to open permanent trade relations "
"with the Sea Elves, but the Wereshark, as always, intended merely to plunder "
"all we could. Aside the war galleons Cliff Racer and Silver Arrow (hired "
"from Beldros Hlaalu for a decent fee and percentage of the booty) we sailed "
"with a wind at our backs and enough supplies to feed an army of ravenous "
"Nords for months. As with all our expeditions, things went just fine until "
"they didn't. Those Maormer sea serpents? They aren't just legends.\n"
"\n"
"Our first encounter came shortly after we first sighted a jungle isle common "
"to Sea Elves, in the distance cloaked by a dense fog. The sound of snapping "
"wood and screaming men drifted across the sea as the Wereshark, myself, and "
"every armed sailor rushed to the Pale Spirit's deck. We were just in time to "
"see the Cliff Racer's broken hull sinking below the waves, wrapped in the "
"scaled coils of an enormous snake.\n"
"\n"
"Never one for half measures, the Wereshark shouted for every archer on the "
"boat to loose arrows. Arrows peppered the slimy beast as it dragged the "
"Cliff Racer to her grave, yet no shaft could penetrate the beast's thick "
"scales. That's when that old lizard Hard-Scales grabbed his poison daggers "
"and leapt into the sea, shouting something about Sithis. That crazy Argonian "
"has had a death wish since the day he signed on.\n"
"\n"
"Wouldn't you know it, as Mighty Flicka boomed warnings to the Silver Arrow "
"from atop the mainmast and the Wereshark rallied every sailor capable of "
"swinging a sword, something surfaced on the frothing sea. Old Hard-Scales, "
"covered in glistening black serpent blood, and behind him, the bobbing "
"length of a massive Maormer serpent. Stiff and dead as something dragged in "
"by a barn cat.\n"
"\n"
"Now, don't ask me how Hard-Scales managed to get his daggers through its "
"scales, or how he managed to breath under the sea for all that time, or how "
"he knew his poison was vile enough to drop a snake twice as long as a "
"galleon. All I know is Hard-Scales never talked about it, after, save for "
"expressions of disappointment over failing to meet Sithis once more. As we "
"took on survivors from the Cliff Racer, the Wereshark pledged a full chest "
"of booty to Hard-Scales. No one complained. \n"
"\n"
"Wary of more serpents, the Wereshark gave orders to anchor off the shore of "
"the fog-cloaked jungle isle, in shallow water where we could see anything "
"between us and the sea floor. Pale Spirit and Silver Arrow sent four boats "
"ashore with the Wereshark at their head. Yet not one water-colored Sea Elf "
"showed his face when we made landing.\n"
"\n"
"We all thought the island abandoned. We could not have been more wrong."

"A Story by Hildegard\n"
"\n"
"One day, while hunting for rabbits on the slopes of Mount Trolhetta, the "
"Silver Werewolf flicked her ears at the sound of mournful sobbing on the "
"wind. Never one to ignore suffering, the Silver Werewolf threw her line of "
"rabbits across her shoulder and lumbered toward the sound. Eventually she "
"found a massive, bearded giant all alone at a snuffed out campfire, roaring "
"sadness at the sky.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Why do you cry?\"\" the Silver Werewolf snarled, and the giant "
"understood thanks to the Medallion of Gulibeg the Quick Fox that she wore "
"around her neck. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"My mate gone. My child gone. Vanished, as I slept. There are many tiny "
"tracks. I fear Goblins have taken them.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"He was not wrong. The Silver Werewolf's keen nose detected the stench of at "
"least a dozen Goblins, as well as the lingering scent of paralytic poison. "
"The giant's family was not dead, but they soon would be, slaughtered to feed "
"the hungry Goblin tribe. No one deserved that cruel fate.\n"
"\n"
"The Silver Werewolf straightened and growled deep, a promise. \"\"The "
"Goblins will not keep them.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Bring them home and you may ask anything of me.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I will ask you to smile,\"\" was her only reply.\n"
"\n"
"Nose to the ground, the Silver Werewolf tracked the Goblin stench down Mount "
"Trolhetta, across the Smokefrost Peaks, to a massive Goblin encampment on "
"the fringes of Lost Prospect. It held far more Goblins than she had ever "
"seen in one place, which was why they had been brave enough to kidnap giants "
"for food. A small tribe would never have dared anger the vengeful giants.\n"
"\n"
"Even for the Silver Werewolf, who could tear apart a dozen Goblins without "
"ruffling her fur, a camp of hundreds was too dangerous. She would have to be "
"clever. Scenting a nearby corpse, an idea dawned on her. She shifted into "
"her Nord form and cloaked herself in the dead woman's rags. Thus clothed and "
"looking entirely harmless, she wandered into the Goblins' camp like a "
"helpless Nord lost in the snow.\n"
"\n"
"The Goblins came for her at once, but all they saw was an unarmed Nord woman "
"dressed in rags. A fine prize. Rather than attacking, they eagerly trussed "
"up the Silver Werewolf and took her to their food pens, where they kept all "
"those caught until it came time to cook them for supper. Once there, they "
"threw the Silver Werewolf into a makeshift wooden cage and left her to "
"freeze to death in the cold.\n"
"\n"
"As she'd hoped, the overconfident Goblins had played right into her hands. "
"Even muffled by her Nord form, the Silver Werewolf's nose detected the smell "
"of giants nearby. Now, all she had to do was wait until dark, and make her "
"escape with the giant's family and any others who wished freedom.\n"
"\n"
"Dark fell and the Goblins grew sleepy, leaving only their trained durzogs to "
"prowl the edges of the food paddocks. It was a bad night for hunting, but a "
"good night for sneaking, as clouds crept in to obscure the moon. The Silver "
"Werewolf shifted forms in the dark and quietly snapped the bars of her "
"wooden cage. While those bars would cage a Nord, they were no match for her "
"bestial strength.\n"
"\n"
"Silent as a shadow, the Silver Werewolf prowled the food paddocks until her "
"keen nose detected one with giants inside. Just as quietly she opened it, "
"crept inside, and slashed the bonds holding down the giantess and her little "
"one. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"Your loved one waits where you left him,\"\" she whispered in a low "
"growl.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Thank you, Moon-kissed. We will see him again, or die trying.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"On her way out, the Silver Werewolf spotted another paddock filled with "
"Nords, moaning with piteous cries. Despite her distaste for these wolf-"
"killers, animals who killed for sport and not for food, she knew they could "
"be useful in their own way. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"Run now!\"\" She snarled to the giantess as she tore into the Nord "
"paddock, snarling and drooling as she menaced them with her claws.\n"
"\n"
"Screaming Nords burst from their cage in all directions, alerting durzog and "
"Goblin alike. In the commotion, the Silver Werewolf found the giantess and "
"led her toward the camp's edge. Goblins challenged them, but were cut down "
"by the Silver Werewolf's claws and teeth or smashed by the dozens at the "
"hands of the vengeful giantess.\n"
"\n"
"Soon only the durzogs pursued them, but one deafening howl from the Silver "
"Werewolf sent the cowed dogs skittering back to their masters. A number of "
"Nords had escaped as well, the Silver Werewolf saw, and she had no doubt "
"they would return in force to smash the Goblins soon. That is what Nords "
"did, and this time only, the Silver Werewolf wished them luck.\n"
"\n"
"Under cover of darkness, the Silver Werewolf led the giantess back up Mount "
"Trolhetta and there, at the campfire, the family was reunited. The lonely "
"giant clutched his child and mate as he babbled his thanks in his guttural "
"tongue. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"How? How can I repay you?\"\"\n"
"\n"
" Thinking of her own pups, she repeated:\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I will ask you to smile, so I can see how you treasure them above all "
"else.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And he did."

"By Chanter Wobolan, Cathedral Historian\n"
"\n"
"What do the ruins of Knightsgrave represent? And why are they important to "
"the Cathedral of Akatosh and the Order of the Hour? Those are questions that "
"the common person never asks, but that every one of the devoted should know "
"the answer.\n"
"\n"
"Most consider Knightsgrave to be some sort of ruined graveyard, a memory of "
"a time when the Empire was strong and eternal. Few realize that the "
"graveyard came later. The true meaning of the site waits in the depths below."
" In the beginning, the massive subterranean structure served as the original "
"headquarters of the Order of the Hour.\n"
"\n"
"It was Ennon Decan, founder of the Order, who raised the stones of the "
"headquarters. Legends claim the site was always important to those who "
"worship the Dragon God, but I have located no records that indicate why this "
"may be the case. Know that the Order established chambers for training and "
"meditation, places for prayer and contemplation, and even areas where the "
"members of the Order could rest and relax.\n"
"\n"
"With the death of Ennon and his original group of companions, great statues "
"were raised in memory of the founders. The Order would continue, operating "
"out of this location for nearly one hundred years. During this period, more "
"chambers were carved out and more improvements were made to the headquarters."
" As the first phase of the Order came to a close and the organization "
"disbanded, the place was locked up and turned over to the Cathedral of "
"Akatosh for safekeeping. The Cathedral, however, didn't know what to do with "
"the facility. So the Chanters and Sermonizers decided to turn the "
"subterranean structure into a crypt of sorts. All of the honored dead of the "
"Order of the Hour were interred within its depths.\n"
"\n"
"When Cavor Merula reestablished the Order, one of his first tasks was to "
"dedicate the site that had become known as Knightsgrave to the memory of the "
"Order's founding members. Blessings and rituals were performed, giving "
"substance to the Exalted Dead that lingered in the place's shadowy interior. "
"Not wanting to disturb those resting herein, Cavor instead set out to build "
"the Enclave of the Hourglass as the Order's new home on the Gold Coast.\n"
"\n"
"So, forget the legends. Ignore the tales of nixad infestations, minotaur "
"protectors, and Exalted Knights of the Order still patrolling the sealed "
"chambers deep below. Knightsgrave is the proud and vibrant legacy of the "
"Order of the Hour. And as followers of Akatosh, it is our legacy, as well."

"A Primer for Novitiates by Chanter Amia\n"
"\n"
"Novitiates, allow me to once again welcome to your new role in the service "
"of Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time. You begin upon a journey of great "
"importance and spiritual reward, but you are not the first to tread this "
"path, nor will you be the last. Many share this journey and will tackle the "
"same challenges that stand before you. While your path may not lead to the "
"same destination as your fellow novitiates, it does travel in the same "
"general direction.\n"
"\n"
"As you begin to perform the duties of the Cathedral of Akatosh, you must ask "
"yourself how you wish to revere the Dragon God of Time. Will you spread the "
"word of the Dragon God through prayer and guidance, leading worshipers "
"through their devotions and hearing their pleas? Or will you take to the "
"pulpit and the street with holy texts in hand, speaking the truths of the "
"Divines to those who require a rekindling of the fires of faith? After you "
"complete your initiations, you will be asked to make that choice. To take up "
"the mantle of Chanter or Sermonizer. Reflect on your decision carefully, for "
"the demands of each branch in the path are very different.\n"
"\n"
"Remember that the Primate oversees all aspects of Akatosh worship in the "
"Cathedral, supported equally by the Grand Chanter and the Grand Sermonizer. "
"For this reason, Chanters and Sermonizers stand shoulder-to-shoulder, "
"bringing the light of Akatosh to the masses in equal but different ways.\n"
"\n"
"As a Chanter, you will follow the lead of the Grand Chanter, offering "
"compassion and guidance to those who come to our Cathedral in need. You will "
"learn to mend their bodies, minds, and spirits with prayer and wisdom, as "
"well as become a teacher yourself, leading worshipers through their "
"offerings and rituals so that they can grow closer to Akatosh.\n"
"\n"
"As a Sermonizer, you will muster behind the Grand Sermonizer, armoring your "
"conviction against the great enemies of heresy and infidelity to guide the "
"lost and faithless back to the protective wings of the Dragon God. You will "
"learn to wield words that will strike at the heart, purging the impurities "
"of dark influence and self-indulgence. The wicked must be chastised and "
"condemned before they may be redeemed, and it is you who will drive out "
"their darkness.\n"
"\n"
"Do not mistake this division of duties for a lack of unity in purpose. We "
"are guided by the Primate, who has the wisdom to see that both paths are "
"equally important to the reverence of Akatosh. The Primate is the guiding "
"light of our Cathedral, improving the lives of all who look upon its shining "
"brilliance. The Primate, like Akatosh, will never lead you astray.\n"
"\n"
"And if a different task calls to you, one of military service and the need "
"to safeguard the faithful, consider pledging yourself to the Order of the "
"Hour. Keeping the Cathedral and the faithful of Akatosh safe from the "
"dangers of the world is a noble calling, should the more spiritual nature of "
"life in the Cathedral seem like too mundane a method to show your devotion "
"to the Dragon God of Time.\n"
"\n"
"These paths stand before you, novitiate. May Akatosh guide you to your "
"ultimate destination."

"Day 1: Today we arrived at Garlas Agea, at the behest of the Gold Coast "
"Trading Company. The company wants us to disarm some—as they referred to "
"them—ancient mechanical inconveniences. Upon seeing these "
"\"\"inconveniences\"\" with my own eyes, I'm a bit more worried than I was "
"before I arrived. The contrivances are giant Akaviri blades that swing the "
"width of one of the main halls. Not quite sure what to do with them, I think "
"we should explore the rest of this death trap and carefully watch for "
"anything that might suddenly leap out and kill us.\n"
"\n"
"Day 2: So, the giant swinging blades aren't the only obstacles we have to "
"deal with. Lucius, probably my best scout, choked on his own tongue when he "
"ventured into one of the main rooms. Turns out, the floors in that room spew "
"noxious gas. At this rate, I may lose a couple more of my best workers "
"before we get this place cleaned out. I'm going to have to renegotiate our "
"fee if I make it out of these ruins in one piece.\n"
"\n"
"Day 4: Finally got those damn gas traps shut off, and I managed to do it "
"without losing another worker. I still ordered my workers not to spend too "
"much time in that chamber. I'm sure more gas is seeping in somehow. "
"Regardless, we've made more progress into the ruins.\n"
"\n"
"Day 7: We found the other end of what we think is the hall with those damn "
"swinging blade traps. Sabrina seems to think she can make it past them if "
"she times it right. I would rather try to block them off with a few wooden "
"planks then send her through those swinging monstrosities. This may at least "
"immobilize them so we can prepare for the reconstruction of the main hall.\n"
"\n"
"Day 9: Success! We managed to immobilize the swinging blades. We even "
"managed to put some scaffolding up. Seems I may not have as hard of a time "
"with this place as I initially feared.\n"
"\n"
"Day 10: The blade traps unexpectedly broke free of the blockade, killing one "
"of my workers. We seem to be trapped back here now. Only one of the "
"blockades still holds, but for how long? Sabrina said she was thinking about "
"making a run for it.\n"
"\n"
"Day 11: Sabrina made a run for it. It didn't go as she planned, but I'm "
"thinking about just going for it as well. The thought of Sabrina bleeding "
"and dying from those brutal wounds is the only thing holding me back. A "
"couple of the mercenaries we hired were able to throw us some food and a few "
"wine skins, but we're going to have to figure out something soon or we're "
"still going to die here. If I can work up the courage, I may run through the "
"blades of death. Tomorrow."

"By Lady Augustine Viliane, Sibyl of the House of Dibella\n"
"\n"
"The skies over Wayrest are stormy and changeable, more often gray than blue, "
"but some mornings in Second Seed the sun rises into heavens blue and clear, "
"and a mild, warm breeze blows in from the Iliac Bay. It was on just such a "
"morning, under trees fragrant with blossoms, that I was welcoming several "

"\"\"If the Aedra sacrificed themselves, each to add something to the making "
"of the world, what did Our Lady contribute to the world?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"In reply, I scooped a double handful of fallen blossoms from the sward and "

" \"\"I am troubled, Holy Sibyl,\"\" said the hostler from Northpoint, "
"\"\"for I know not who is my father.\"\"\n"

"\"\"That is naught to the Goddess of Beauty,\"\" I gently replied, \"\"for "

"\"\"What if a congregant seeks me as ardor-partner,\"\" said the knight's "

"\n"
"The origin of the race of trolls is somewhat obscure—which is another way of "
"saying we know absolutely nothing about where they come from, how they got "
"here, or why they exist at all. \n"
"\n"
"The troll has certainly haunted Tamrielic folklore from time immemorial, "
"known to nearly every culture and appearing in tales of all sorts, from "
"children's fables to the histories of the ancients. Indeed, they are "
"mentioned in Khosey's venerable \"\"Tamrilean Tractates,\"\" which speak of "
"\"\"ye Trohl of Rapace, thrice-orbed Enormity [that] Eateth ye Fleshe of "
"[both] Commons and Kyngs.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"After our long history on Tamriel with them, we men and mer should really "
"know quite a bit about trolls, should we not? Perhaps so—but we don't. The "
"few facts at our disposal are as follows:\n"
"\n"
"-	Trolls are fierce and formidable carnivores, devouring anything they can "
"catch down to fingernails and marrow. \n"
"-	A troll injured by any means but fire heals with preternatural speed, a "
"regeneration almost certainly magical in nature.\n"
"-	Troll fat is a reagent prized by alchemists, though its virtues seem to "
"vary depending on different recipes and rendering techniques. \n"
"-	Despite their physical prowess, trolls are reclusive creatures, and their "
"lairs are usually found well off the beaten track. \n"
"\n"
"We can say little else with certainty, save that trolls live in a range of "
"habitats and seem to exist in variations appropriate to their environment of "
"origin. The most common, and therefore best-known types of trolls, include "
"the Forest Trolls of central Tamriel, and the Frost Trolls of the far north. "
"\n"
"\n"
"But history and legend tell us of other types of trolls, more obscure "
"perhaps, but no less fascinating. Some, like the Lava Trolls of Vvardenfell, "
"are almost certainly extinct (if, indeed, they ever existed outside the "
"fevered imaginations of Dark Elf corner club raconteurs). But today we shall "
"speak of a rare breed of \"\"Trohl of Rapace\"\" that you can definitely "
"still encounter—and not in far-off regions like Middle Argonia or Topal "
"Island. They live in Cyrodiil itself … if one knows where to look for them. \n"
"\n"
"I'm speaking of the elusive River Troll. You won't find it listed on the "
"Imperial Register of Beasts and Lower Beings, but it's real nonetheless, as "
"I can readily attest. I myself have personally seen, in the marketplace of "
"Sutch, the carcass of a River Troll that was brought in by an intrepid "
"hunter who traps the tributaries of the Brena. She told me they lair out of "
"sight in riverside caves or burrows, subsisting on mudcrabs, large fish, and "
"crocodiles—as well as upon unwary people, when they can get them. This might "
"be why they're so rarely reported, as few survive such an encounter.\n"
"\n"
"The appearance of the corpse, fire-scarred though it was, bore out the brave "
"hunter's account. Unlike the familiar forest variety, this River Troll's "
"hide was clad in shiny water-shedding scales, silver-blue in color and as "
"durable as they were flexible. The long scaly hands had webbing between the "
"clawed fingers, and the fangs were the sharp, spiky teeth of fish-eaters. "
"The hunter said they can hold their breath for long periods, lurking unseen "
"in the shallows until they erupt from ambush to overwhelm their prey. \n"
"\n"
"Since that encounter I've questioned others who range the wild places of "
"Cyrodiil and learned that the experience of the hunter of Sutch was not "
"unique. River Trolls, though rarely seen, can be found lurking in the "
"watersheds of the Brena, Strid, and central Niben river systems, and "
"doubtless account for a fair percentage of the livestock—and people—who go "
"missing in these regions. Knowing what I do now has certainly persuaded me "
"to confine my nature walks to paths on the drier uplands, lest I end my "
"scholarly career as fodder for trollkins in some muddy riverside burrow!"

"The Historic City of Kvatch\n"
"\n"
"The hilltop city of Kvatch is one of the oldest Colovian cities in Cyrodiil, "
"with a rich history and vibrant tradition. The inhabitants of Kvatch enjoy a "
"reputation for being well-read and pleasant, as well as conservative and "
"pious. For those devout travelers who wish to commune with or learn more "
"about the Divines, the priests of Kvatch welcome pilgrims for devotions and "
"worship with open arms.\n"
"\n"
"The legendary Great Cathedral of Akatosh dominates Kvatch's skyline, with an "
"awe-inspiring profile and elegant interior. With shrines to each of the "
"Divines, the Cathedral draws visitors from far and wide to gaze upon its "
"majesty and beauty.The venerable Order of the Hour, protectors of the "
"Primate of Akatosh and the Cathedral, can often be seen going about their "
"duties in and around the Cathedral. They supplement the efforts of the "
"Kvatch Warders, who have kept watch over the city for generations. Between "
"the two groups, Kvatch remains one of the safest places in all of the Empire."
"\n"
"\n"
"But don't think Kvatch serves only as a destination for worship and "
"reflection. It also hosts one of the oldest fighting pits in Tamriel—the "
"legendary Kvatch Arena. While no arena can rival the one in Imperial City, "
"many of that arena's best fighters got their start right here on the Gold "
"Coast. Enjoying a match at the Kvatch Arena provides a great opportunity to "
"see novice fighters before they earn a place in Imperial City.\n"

"The Cosmopolitan Paradise of Anvil\n"

"The port of call when journeying to the Gold Coast, Anvil is the crown jewel "

"\n"
"As the Gold Coast's finest port city, Anvil hosts retreats for royalty and "
"dignitaries from across Cyrodiil and beyond. The wise and noble Count Ephrem "
"Benirus bears the title of Imperial Prefect and governs this fine city at "
"the pleasure of the Emperor, who often visits during the summer months. A "
"lucky visitor may witness our great Emperor Leovic waving to his loyal "
"subjects from the balcony of Anvil Castle.\n"
"\n"
"Travelers from all over come to take advantage of the wonderful open air "
"markets, filled with curiosities and delicacies from across Tamriel. Others "
"come to dine at the many fine eateries. Still others frolic on the sandy "
"beaches and swim the clear waters of the Abecean Sea. While the city has "
"many luxurious accommodations for noble families and those of means, some of "
"the citizenry also cater to visitors with a smaller purse, offering guest "
"rooms in their own cozy, beach-front cottages.\n"
"\n"
"Ultimately, there is no more desirable travel destination than the temperate "
"and beautiful Gold Coast. Whether you come on a pilgrimage to the Great "
"Cathedral of Akatosh, stay to enjoy the exciting fights at the Kvatch Arena, "
"delve into our ancient ruins, or take in the metropolitan splendor of Anvil, "
"you will find the luxuries and adventures you seek on the edge of the "

"\n"
"The Gold Coast serves as a wonderful destination for travelers that seek the "
"most interesting sights in Cyrodiil and enjoy the fine weather and sandy "
"yellow beaches of Anvil. While caution is always warranted whenever "
"traveling abroad, the visionary polices and leadership of Emperor Leovic "
"have dramatically increased safety across our shores. The Emperor himself "
"often vacations with us, and there is no better time than now to take that "
"trip you've always desired to the temperate Gold Coast.\n"
"\n"
"With bright sun and clear waves, the Gold Coast enjoys a pleasant climate "
"fueled by warmer currents from the Abecean Sea. We offer a verdant paradise "
"perfect for a hearty sort looking for true adventure on a reasonable budget. "
"The Imperial Navy, tasked by our great Emperor with patrolling the Abecean "
"Sea and ensuring safety and security across the region, makes its home port "
"in Anvil, and no pirate dares challenge our Emperor's might. His capable, "
"well-armed navy and accomplished soldiers ensure your safety.\n"

"A Fertile Land Bound by Two Great Rivers\n"
"\n"
"Two rivers of significant size border the Gold Coast. To the north, the "
"Brena River separates Cyrodiil from Hammerfell, and to the south, the Strid "
"River marks the border with Valenwood. Both rivers are crucial trade routes "
"to the interior of the continent. In years past, numerous pirate clans laid "
"claim to both rivers, but the presence of the Imperial Navy has put an end "
"to such activities.\n"
"\n"
"To truly appreciate the scale of our great rivers, one must witness the "
"bustle of good-laden galleons sailing up and down the Brena and the Strid at "
"the peak of trade season. While we welcome you to sail our rivers in summer, "
"we advise against winter visits. In those months, humidity and fog make the "
"rivers most unpleasant. \n"
"* * *\n"
"The Beauty and Mystery of the Western Uplands\n"
"\n"
"Much of the Gold Coast interior consists of rocky highlands and low "
"mountains dotted with trees, including dense oak, beech, and ash forests in "
"the foothills. These areas make for perfect hiking tours or guided "
"expeditions to our many ancient ruins, which are of particular interest to "
"scholars and historians. As much of Colovia's wealth comes from logging, our "
"lumber magnates maintain operations across the Gold Coast. Colovian wood "
"remains in great demand for construction and weaponry.\n"
"\n"
"Our highlands are also prone to heavy seasonal fog, which has sparked a "
"number of superstitions, including tales of \"\"bull men\"\" stalking our "
"ruins! While these are merely rumors spread by bandits inhabiting the "
"highlands, we do suggest you carry weapons or travel with an armed escort. "
"In the Gold Coast, your safety is our paramount concern, and we work hard to "
"make your stay as pleasant and enjoyable as possible."

"by Shelga gra-Bur, Beastmaster of Kvatch\n"
"\n"
"Do you laugh when you see dire wolves? Do you think they are big, dumb "
"cousins of normal wolves? Then you are stupid. Dire wolves are cunning and "
"deadly. To them, your laughter says, \"\"I am the next thing to fill your "
"belly.\"\" Shelga laughed at dire wolves once. Now Shelga has one ear.\n"
"\n"
"Shelga is no longer stupid. Now Shelga is beastmaster of Kvatch, the city "
"with the dire wolf banner. This is why Shelga spends much time taming dire "
"wolves.\n"
"\n"
"You may think it impossible to tame dire wolves. This is true. Predators "
"cannot be tamed. Not really. But if Shelga called it a \"\"Guide to Making "
"Dire Wolves Eat Your Enemies and Not You,\"\" none would purchase. Or "
"purchase for the wrong reasons.\n"
"\n"
"—\n"
"\n"
"First thing. A dire wolf looks like a wolf. It moves like a wolf. It smells "
"like a wolf. But it is not. It is a dire wolf.\n"
"\n"
"Sounds easy, but easy to forget.\n"
"\n"
"A wolf needs a pack. A wolf with no pack is vicious. It is afraid to be "
"alone. With effort you can tame a wolf. Give it food if it is hungry. Make "
"it think it is part of your pack.\n"
"\n"
"A dire wolf needs no pack. This is because a dire wolf is one whole wolf "
"pack. It is vicious only if it wants to be. It is not afraid to be alone "
"because it is a dire wolf.\n"
"\n"
"You cannot tame a dire wolf like a wolf. If it is ever hungry, you are food. "
"It needs no pack but itself. You must show it you are a pack as well. Show "
"how your pack and its pack should travel together for more food. A dire wolf "
"understands this because it eats as much as one whole wolf pack.\n"
"\n"
"—\n"
"\n"
"Second thing. A dire wolf has a long memory. It is like a clan-mother with "
"grudges from forty years ago. Don't give it reason to hate you. Shelga's "
"sister Gralga once slapped a dire wolf for eating off her plate. This is how "
"Gralga lost a thumb and learned manners at the same time. Gralga doesn't "
"visit Kvatch anymore.\n"
"\n"
"If a dire wolf comes to hate you, do not back down. Do not cower. Show it "
"you know its hate. Show it you don't fear its hate. This shows respect. Then "
"give it much food to smother the hate.\n"
"\n"
"Shelga thinks this is why Kvatch puts the dire wolf on its flag. Kvatch does "
"not forget. Kvatch respects those who show it respect. And Kvatch will "
"smother its hate if you throw its people many banquets.\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes the dire wolf still hates you. Then you must kill the dire wolf. "
"Do not do so in sight of a dire wolf's mate or it will hate you too. Just "
"like people.\n"
"\n"
"—\n"
"\n"
"Third thing. Scratch the belly. Scratch behind the ear, but not in the ear. "
"Scratch where the tail meets the back. Top part of tail only! Scratch below "
"the chin.\n"
"\n"
"Do not scratch the paws. Dire wolf paws are sensitive, like High Elves. Also "
"they have sharp claws. When a dire wolf thinks you want to take its paws "
"away, it will come to hate you.\n"
"\n"
"—\n"
"\n"
"Last thing. A dire wolf is clever but it doesn't understand magic. So use "
"magic. Scrolls are cheaper than a  false hand. Don't try to tame a dire wolf "
"like in the stories. Don't be stupid.\n"
"\n"
"Shelga's sister Bolga says this is cheating. That a dire wolf made tame by "
"magic is not a dire wolf. Shelga calls Bolga many names. Bolga does not back "
"down, earning Shelga's respect. Then Bolga sends Shelga boiled thunderbug "
"eggs.\n"
"\n"
"Shelga says if even Bolga can learn, so can you."

"\"\"This was no run of the mill murder, baroness,\"\" Investigator Vale said "
"as she rose and stepped back from the body. \"\"No, this was an "
"assassination. The work of the Shadow Fellowship, or I'm a Morrowind "
"mushroom. I'd stake my reputation on that.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The Shadow Fellowship?\"\" Baroness Esmonda exclaimed, raising a dainty "
"hand to her full, red lips. \"\"The league of assassins? That's just a "
"myth!\"\" Despite her protestations, the baroness suddenly went pale and "
"looked around nervously.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Oh, the Shadow Fellowship is quite real,\"\" Vale said, slipping off her "
"leather gloves and returning them to the pocket of her long coat. "
"\"\"They've operated in secret for hundreds of years. Whenever someone gets "
"too close to the truth, they employ bribery, blackmail, and murder to keep "
"their activities hidden. I've made a study of the clandestine "
"organization—covertly, of course—but I've never had a case that so clearly "
"points to their involvement.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Doesn't that frighten you?\"\" the baroness asked. \"\"I would "
"completely understand if you decided to abandon this investigation ….\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"My dear baroness, I have never abandoned an investigation in my life and "
"I'm not about to start now,\"\" Vale said indignantly. \"\"I just need to "
"determine how best to proceed.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"That night, in a richly appointed room above the town's inn, Investigator "
"Vale slept fitfully after talking to dozens of people and following up on a "
"half-dozen leads. Dark dreams troubled her rest, causing Vale to toss and "
"turn in the small bed.\n"
"\n"
"Suddenly, Vale sat up, letting the sheet fall away from her body as she drew "
"out the dagger she always kept under her pillow. She pointed it squarely at "
"the dark form sitting in the room's only chair. The figure snapped her "
"fingers and the candle beside the bed ignited with a spark. It helped a "
"little, but mostly it just threw more shadows around the room.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You're from the Fellowship, I presume?\"\" Vale asked.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Let's not apply any labels, shall we?\"\" the woman said. Her face was "
"still obscured by shadows and a mass of long, dark hair, but Vale could see "
"that she was dressed in tight leather and wore at least three blades that "
"the investigator could readily spot.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Have you come to murder me in my sleep?\"\" Vale asked, her own blade "
"never wavering.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Neither I nor my associates have any desire to see the great "
"Investigator Vale come to harm,\"\" the leather-clad woman said. \"\"There's "
"no profit in that. We have one more contract to complete and then we'll fade "
"away like dew in the morning sun.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The baroness!\"\" Vale exclaimed.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You are as perceptive as we've heard,\"\" the woman said. \"\"But "
"sometimes even perception arrives too late to change the inevitable.\"\" The "
"woman rose and stepped to the room's single window. \"\"Enjoy the rest of "
"your evening, investigator,\"\" she said with a slight bow before slipping "
"into the night.\n"
"\n"
"Investigator Vale did not sleep the rest of that long, dark night.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"In the morning, Vale returned to the baroness's manor house to find that the "
"town guard was already at the scene. She approached the captain, an older "
"man she had worked with in the past, and nodded a grim greeting.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The baroness is dead,\"\" Vale said. It wasn't a question.\n"
"\n"
"The captain of the guard nodded. \"\"Fell down the steps in the night and "
"broke her neck,\"\" he said. \"\"Must have been the grief over her husband's "
"murder that made her careless. Such a shame, but there was no way to stop an "
"accident like that.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Yes,\"\" Vale agreed. \"\"But there will be a reckoning.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And with that, Investigator Vale turned and departed the manor house, "
"already thinking of numerous ways to deal with the Shadow Fellowship. "
"Someday, perhaps, she would take on these villains. But not today.\n"
"\n"
"Not today."

"The Journal of Captain Jena Apinia\n"
"\n"
"I've been called a lot of things during my career. I've received accolades "
"from my friends and allies, been branded with curses and other foul "
"descriptors by my enemies, but no title has been more hurtful and undeserved "
"than the one I carry with me now—the one I'll most likely carry with me to "
"my grave. They call me \"\"the Butcher of Bravil.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The war in Cyrodiil was in full swing when suddenly a new danger appeared to "
"threaten Imperial City. My soldiers were enjoying a much-deserved break from "
"battle when chains fell from the sky. Some claimed one of the alliances had "
"called upon strange and deadly magic to harass Imperial City, while others "
"were sure that one Daedric Prince or another was behind this latest "
"indignation. For my part, I didn't care if it was Queen Ayrenn or Molag Bal. "
"I just knew I had to get the soldiers under my charge away from there as "
"quickly as possible.\n"
"\n"
"The goal before me was simple: Survive. Not die trying to defend the "
"Imperial City from an enemy we didn't understand. It was to live, to fight "
"another day when victory was more assured. Some call me coward for running "
"as I did, but I saved a full legion's worth of soldiers with my actions. Of "
"course, fleeing from the city as quickly as we did, we were ill prepared for "
"surviving in the wilds beyond the city walls. We needed to regroup, "
"resupply, and determine a prudent course of action. With these things in "
"mind, I ordered my legion to head south and away from the city.\n"
"\n"
"Bravil is a squalid little town south of the Imperial City, located on the "
"banks of the Niben Bay. To say that Bravil is a poor town is an "
"understatement. The people there would be happy to be risen to that economic "
"level. They lived in wooden shacks stacked one atop the other, like skeevers "
"in a burrow. They didn't have much, but what they did have was desperately "
"needed by me and my legion. It was their duty to aid us, for the welfare and "
"glory of the Empire. I explained that quite succinctly to Bravil's mayor.\n"
"\n"
"And Bravil's mayor graciously refused my request. \"\"The food stores we "
"have, pitiful though they may be, are vital to the survival of Bravil and "
"its people,\"\" he explained. \"\"Surely you understand why I must say no, "
"Captain, and humbly ask that you and your soldiers move on.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"To say that the man infuriated me is like saying that the Skald King is only "
"a slightly drunk fool. But I understood his dilemma. If I took the town's "
"food supply, he'd have to watch as half his citizens slowly died of "
"starvation as the cold of winter settled over the town and the surrounding "
"area. The solution was simple, though it grieved me to give the order. My "
"soldiers would have to eliminate half the town's population. That would give "
"the remaining citizens a chance to scrounge up enough food to make it "
"through the winter.\n"
"\n"
"Here I thought I was helping these pathetic creatures, but did they thank "
"us? No. The rest of the town rose up against us. In the end, we were forced "
"to slaughter a good deal more than half—including the mayor, whom I hold "
"responsible for this entire situation. We gathered up the supplies—as well "
"as a number of valuable items to help finance our efforts—and took our leave "
"of Bravil.\n"
"\n"
"It was a few days later, when we approached another small settlement, that I "
"discovered that word of what happened at Bravil had begun to spread, and the "
"story had grown all out of proportion. They were calling me \"\"the Butcher "
"of Bravil,\"\" regarding me as a sort of villain who went out of her way to "
"kill innocent civilians. They know nothing about war and the hard decisions "
"that a commander must make in the field. Would they rather my soldiers "
"starved? How would we protect them and defend Cyrodiil then? It also came to "
"my attention that Queen Ayrenn had sent one of her damned Eyes to track me "
"down, recover the items we acquired, and make me pay for my so-called war "
"crime. \n"
"\n"
"I sent the bulk of my legion back to rendezvous with the rest of the army "
"outside the Imperial City. Meanwhile, I took a small squad and made for the "
"Gold Coast. I would face the Queen's Eye in a place of my own choosing. Then "
"we'll see whose justice actually prevails."

"I first heard about the vampire lord Zalar-do while exploring the markets of "
"Elden.Root. The stories both fascinated and frightened me. Here was a "
"Khajiit who had gained power and notoriety, whose very name was whispered "
"with fear and a healthy dose of respect. I admit it. I had been pondering "
"the risks and benefits of life as a vampire ever since I was a child. Now, "
"with each tale I heard, every rumor I digested, I realized the goal that was "
"set before me.\n"
"\n"
"I had to find Zalar-do and convince her to turn me into a vampire.\n"
"\n"
"Why do I want to be a vampire? That's a good question. I've certainly asked "
"myself that very same thing on more than one occasion since this obsession "
"grabbed hold of me. I suppose it has something to do with the allure of "
"power and the correlation between vampirism and sex that some scholars go on "
"and on about (yes, I've read every book and letter I could find pertaining "
"to the subject). But if I can be totally honest—and since this is my private "
"journal, I suppose I have to be—the real appeal has to do with the longevity "
"of the species. I've read that ancients can survive hundreds, even thousands "
"of years. As a child who saw both of his parents die much too young, this "
"\"\"immortality\"\" has become a very attractive option to me.\n"
"\n"
"I'm not extremely keen on the idea of drinking blood, however, but I suppose "
"every advantage comes with its own set of disadvantages. Such is the way of "
"the world. I might be squeamish at first, though I expect with time and "
"practice I could even grow to enjoy a daily feast of the crimson liquid. I "
"wonder if it needs to come from an intelligent creature? Or if it has to be "
"fresh? I guess that's what the protruding fangs are for.\n"
"\n"
"Before I could locate Zalar-do's lair or otherwise introduce myself to the "
"vampire lord, the hunter Mel Andrys appeared in town. He asked about "
"disappearances and mysterious deaths, and he even mentioned Zalar-do by name "
"while I eavesdropped on his conversation with one of the town guards. He was "
"going to ruin my chance to meet and offer myself as an apprentice to the "
"vampire lord. I followed the hunter around, watching how he searched for "
"traces of Zalar-do's passing and tracked her to her lair. It was empty, of "
"course. She was much too smart to be caught by the likes of Mel Andrys.\n"
"\n"
"I spent the next few months staying as close to the vampire hunter as I "
"could without revealing my presence. I figured that he'd have a better "
"chance of locating Zalar-do than I would, and once we got close to the "
"vampire lord I was sure I'd be able to figure out how to help her avoid Mel "
"Andrys and convince her to reward me with the power of the vampire. It was "
"this dream that kept me moving, following the hunter from Grahtwood to "
"Greenshade to Malabal Tor, until we eventually made our way to the Gold "
"Coast.\n"
"\n"
"Here, luck was with me. The vampire hunter was indisposed after we docked in "
"Anvil. The rough storm our ship traveled through seems to have made the poor "
"man ill. That gave me time to search for Zalar-do and get a few steps ahead "
"of Mel Andrys. I believe that she has established her lair in Hrota Cave—the "
"perfect location from which to stalk prey in Anvil when the hunger comes "
"upon her. I've made my way to the cave and plan to present myself to the "
"vampire lord forthwith. I can't wait to become one of her apprentices!"

"I haven't felt drawn to this journal in a long time, but recent events seem "

"\n"
"Before I donned the armor of the Black Dragon, I was simply a Silencer FOR "
"the Dark Brotherhood. Now I'm the Black Dragon, Silencer OF the Dark "

"And one I happen to be very good at.\n"

"The woman known as Lyra Viria died at my hands. It was my last act as part "
"of the Dark Brotherhood, my last act in a Sanctuary now long forgotten. "
"After that I was no one and nothing for a time. Until I found the Order and "
"became the Black Dragon. \n"
"\n"
"I'm trying to find redemption in service to Akatosh, but has anything really "
"changed? I'm still a murderer. I still feel damned. But now I'm killing "
"those individuals marked for death by Akatosh himself—or, at least, by his "
"chosen representatives in Tamriel. I suppose that's some kind of improvement."
"\n"
"\n"
"Once I was cocksure and confident in my deeds and actions. This was true in "
"the Dark Brotherhood (until it wasn't) and it was true as the Black Dragon. "
"Now, however, I find that I'm filled with a sort of discontent that makes me "
"do something I've never been really good at—asking questions. I need to "
"think about this and perhaps have another conversation with the Primate."

"\n"
"After Akatosh \"\"called him out of obscurity,\"\" as Primate Artorius has "
"explained numerous times over the years, the young man became a priest of "
"the Divines. He continued to serve in the temple, learning more and more as "
"he split his time among the eight shrines that made up the holy place. His "
"work and dedication, along with his increasing reputation for performing "
"good works, once again brought him to the attention of Primate Jonas of "
"Kvatch.\n"
"\n"
"Artorius longed to be assigned to the Cathedral of Akatosh in Kvatch. He had "
"heard tales of the \"\"grand palace of the Dragon God\"\" and believed there "
"was no other place in all of Tamriel where he could best serve and worship "
"Akatosh. He set out to get the posting, using every avenue at his disposal "
"to make himself enticing to the high priests and the Primate of the "
"Cathedral. In the end, it was the event that came to be called \"\"the "
"Miracle of the First Shrine\"\" that did the trick.\n"
"\n"
"As the story has it, when Casiras the Hunter brought his young son to the "
"temple, the shaft of an arrow jutting from his chest, Priest Artorius "
"immediately went to his aid. Artorius led the grieving father to Akatosh's "
"shrine, and even though the child had clearly been killed by the terrible "
"wound, he began to pray. According to reports, Artorius prayed for three "
"straight days, never pausing to eat, or drink, or even sleep. At the end of "
"the third day, the priest began to speak rapidly in a tongue that no one in "
"the temple could understand. Then, it is said, a burst of brilliant light "
"emanated from the shrine. It struck Artorius and flowed through his body, "
"down his arms, and into his hands before passing on to the dead boy. When "
"the glow subsided, the arrow was gone, the wound was healed, and the child "
"was alive. Everyone said that Akatosh had answered Artorius's prayers.\n"
"\n"
"Word of this reputed miracle spread like wildfire throughout the Empire, "
"quickly reaching the ear of Primate Jonas. He decided that if Akatosh was "
"indeed performing miracles through one of his priests, then that priest "
"needed to be at the Cathedral in Kvatch. Soon, Artorius was at the "
"Cathedral, never far from the Primate's side, taking in his words the way a "
"Nord consumes mead. In time, Artorius rose through the hierarchy of the "
"Cathedral, eventually becoming Grand Sermonizer of Akatosh, second only to "
"the Primate of Kvatch himself.\n"
"\n"
"It was during this latter period that the relationship between the Primate "
"and his Grand Sermonizer began to become strained. Artorius wanted the "
"clergy to become more involved in the growing political unrest spreading "
"throughout the Empire, as well as with the increasing threat of the Knahaten "
"Flu. Jonas, for his part, wanted the Cathedral to remain aloof from secular "
"concerns. The two argued constantly about the subject, finally getting to "
"the point where the Primate was prepared to put an end to the disagreement "
"through any means at his disposal—including sending the Grand Sermonizer to "
"a distant posting.\n"
"\n"
"Before the Primate could carry out his threat, however, he suddenly died "
"under what some believe to be suspicious circumstances. Whispered rumors "
"throughout the streets of Kvatch intimated that the Primate had been "
"murdered—perhaps even by assassins connected to the Dark Brotherhood or some "
"other clandestine organization. After all, the Primate had been preaching "
"about the evils of Daedric cults and similar organizations, and specifically "
"called out the Brotherhood as a pox upon the Gold Coast. Whatever the truth, "
"Jonas's death opened the door for Artorius to advance even higher within the "
"hierarchy.\n"
"\n"
"Artorius Ancrus was elected to the post of Primate of Kvatch. He changed his "
"name to Artorius Ponticus and has been a stabilizing force in the region for "
"most of the last decade."

"\n"
"The Temple of the Divines was the last place Artorius Ancrus ever expected "
"to wind up. But as the year 2E 542 was drawing to a close, that's exactly "
"where the young Imperial found himself. He was serving penance for crimes "
"committed while working for the crime boss Vodunius in Imperial City. Thanks "
"to his father's wealth and influence, Artorius avoided a dungeon cell. As "
"for serving in the temple, he was sure that was his dear father's idea.\n"
"\n"
"As the fourth son, Artorius had been promised to serve the Divines, and "
"despite the young man's best efforts to avoid that fate, it seemed he was "
"destined for a religious life. \"\"I'll serve my year and a day,\"\" "
"Artorius told the priest who was his jailer and would become his mentor, "
"Ilavius Alfeno, \"\"but after that I'm out of here.\"\" The old priest just "
"bowed and began to introduce his charge to religious life.\n"
"\n"
"Artorius's life at the temple became a daily mix of opposing states of "
"activity, from frenzied labor to stillness bordering on inertia. Given an "
"endless array of chores that included cleaning, food preparation, and "
"helping to care for the shrines of the Divines filled each day, punctuated "
"by periods of study, meditation, and prayer, Artorius was soon too busy to "
"maintain his anger at his father. And once his anger subsided, he began to "
"actually hear the words of the priests and learn the tenets of the Divines.\n"
"\n"
"For someone who wanted nothing to do with religion, Artorius quickly became "
"fascinated with the tales and tenets of the Divines. From Arkay to Dibella, "
"Stendarr to Julianos, he visited every shrine in turn and questioned the "
"priests endlessly about their holy sphere and rituals. Of all the Divines, "
"however, the one that seemed to attain a special place in Artorius's "
"imagination was Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time. Perhaps it was Akatosh's "
"place at the head of the pantheon that first attracted Artorius. Or maybe "
"the qualities associated with him, or the tales related to his role as the "
"god-defender of the Empire. Whatever the impetus, the young noble appeared "
"to have found his faith.\n"
"\n"
"When Jonas Coventine, Primate of Akatosh, arrived for his annual visit from "
"Kvatch, he took an immediate liking to the young Artorius. After leading the "
"temple in worship, the Primate invited Artorius to a private meeting. "
"Neither Jonas nor Artorius ever revealed the details of the meeting, but "
"shortly after that audience, Artorius pledged himself to the Divines. When "
"his probation was over, he took the vows of the priesthood and devoted "
"himself to serving Akatosh."

"No one in Kvatch, the Gold Coast, or the shattered remnants of the Empire "
"demonstrates more devotion and piety than Artorius Ponticus, the Primate of "
"Akatosh—and he'll be the first to point this out to you if you aren't savvy "
"enough to see the holy truth for yourself. But how did so humble an "
"individual achieve such an august position in the religious hierarchy? For "
"that tale, we need to go back to where Artorius first turned to Akatosh for "
"guidance and strength—on the streets of the Imperial City in 2E 542.\n"
"\n"
"The fourth son of the wealthy Ancrus family, Artorius grew up without a "
"clear place in the world. His eldest brother was being groomed to take "
"control of the family's major holdings throughout the core of the Empire, "
"while the brother that was next in line was being trained to care for the "
"family's distant holdings in Hammerfell. The third son, Angelus, was already "
"a young officer in the Imperial Legion with a promising military career "
"ahead of him. By tradition, that left a life in service to the Divines as "
"the natural path for Artorius to follow. Unfortunately, young Artorius was "
"about as spiritual and devout as the proverbial lusty Argonian maid of song "
"and legend. He wanted nothing to do with prayer and sacrifice.\n"
"\n"
"Instead, young Artorius found himself drawn to two dangerous preoccupations: "
"first, he was fascinated with events happening in the Breton kingdoms, "
"specifically the ongoing battles between Emeric of Wayrest and Durcorach of "
"the Reach. He scoured Imperial City for anyone who could tell him more about "
"what was happening there, and usually found them in the most unsavory "
"sections of the city. Second, he started to run with employees of the "
"notorious crime boss, Vodunius Monrius, much to the chagrin of his father "
"and older brothers. And it wasn't long before he was carrying messages and "
"taking on other errands for Vodunius and his lieutenants.\n"
"\n"
"Never one to miss an opportunity to teach a lesson, Primate Artorius speaks "
"candidly about this dark time in his past. \"\"I was full of fury and "
"vinegar back then,\"\" he said with a laugh when I interviewed him while "
"researching this book. \"\"I was angry and without direction, looking for "
"something, but I didn't know what it was. That's a recipe for either finding "
"your passion or losing your way. Lucky for me, Akatosh had a plan.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"That plan, the Primate believes, began on a day much like most during that "
"period of young Artorius's life. He started his rounds for the crime boss, "
"collecting gold from the various merchants and artisans working in and "
"around the Market District. The daily tithe was something of a sacred ritual "
"for both those who were forced to pay the price and those who gathered the "
"gold that filled Vodunius's coffers. Artorius was just one of a dozen young "
"men and women who did odd jobs for the crime boss and his lieutenants, but "
"he relished his role and the excitement that accompanied it. At least, he "
"did until the inevitable occurred.\n"
"\n"
"When Artorius entered the shop of the Khajiiti baker, Sticky Paws, he found "
"more waiting for him than the gold he expected to collect for Vodunius's "
"daily tithe. Four officers of the city's Guard were on hand, ready to arrest "
"the young noble and end his recently started life of crime. \"\"Your father "
"is greatly disappointed in you, Artorius,\"\" the Guard Captain said. "
"\"\"You've broken the laws of the Empire, if that gold in your pouch is any "
"indication. You haven't left us with many options.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"At that moment, when he should have been frightened and anxious, Artorius "
"could only manage to conjure up a single emotion—he hated his father with an "
"intensity that burned as hot as Sticky Paws' ovens. The officer of the Guard "
"explained that they could bring the full weight of the law down upon "
"Artorius and toss him in a dungeon cell for a year and a day, or they could "
"come up with a way for him to make amends for the crimes he had committed, "
"but Artorius could barely hear over the pounding of his own blood. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"As a favor to your father,\"\" the officer decided, \"\"we'll go with "
"the latter. A year with the priests of the Divines should help set you back "
"on the straight and narrow.\"\" And just like that, Artorius found himself "
"back in the grasp of a destiny he had tried so hard to avoid. He was sent to "
"perform penance with the priests at the Temple of the Divines."

"Thanks to the actions of Carolus Aquilarios, the Wolf of Kvatch, Anvil's "
"defenses were practically nonexistent when Captain Fortunata—the Pirate "
"Queen—sailed into port. After numerous attempts by the Imperial soldiers "
"stationed at the port city to invade Kvatch, the barracks in Anvil were "
"practically empty due to defeat after defeat at the Wolf's hands. Captain "
"Fortunata's loyal pirates and buccaneers quickly took control of the city "
"and she claimed the title of Provincial Governor for herself. \n"
"\n"
"That might have been the end of things, as far as Count Carolus was "
"concerned, except for what the Pirate Queen decided to do next. She declared "
"that the Gold Coast was now an independent state, free and separate from "
"Cyrodiil and the Empire. When she requested that Kvatch join Anvil as part "
"of the new order, the count refused, preferring to continue to owe fealty to "
"Emperor Varen. Not feeling totally confident at the time, Fortunata didn't "
"press the demand. But she wouldn't forget the count's lack of support. When "
"the Soulburst occurred and Varen disappeared, she took advantage of Kvatch's "
"sudden isolation to make her demands more forceful.\n"
"\n"
"Anvil began pressing Kvatch to join the Gold Coast, both diplomatically and "
"by increasingly underhanded means. Marauders and bandit gangs began to "
"appear along the Gold Road around Kvatch, disrupting trade and harassing "
"travelers. Kvatch's elite guards, the Warders, were dispatched to deal with "
"the bandits, but each time the bandits were able to escape to the Strid "
"River. They returned in greater numbers, amplifying their attacks by raiding "
"outlying farms and sending frightened refugees into the city for protection.\n"
"\n"
"Despite these acts of aggression, Carolus remained staunch and refused to "
"negotiate with the Pirate Queen. Infuriated, Fortunata announced that Kvatch "
"would be formally annexed into the Gold Coast. She sent the Anvil Guard to "
"take command of the city. The Count of Kvatch responded by putting the "
"Warders upon the walls and sending the cohort out to confront the invaders. "
"The opposing forces met on the Gold Road, near the Gottshaw Inn. The more "
"disciplined and highly trained cohort scattered the motley guards from "
"Anvil, but the situation wasn't as it appeared. It was a trap. An army of "
"pirates exploded out of hiding and surrounded the cohort. While ragged and "
"undisciplined, the pirates outnumbered the legionaries six to one. The "
"cohort was wiped out in what has come to be known as the Gottshaw Massacre.\n"
"\n"
"Carolus Aquilarios had no choice. Without the support of the cohort, he had "
"no option other than to swear fealty to the Gold Coast. Now, caught between "
"the Pirate Queen and the Primate of Akatosh, the Count seethes at his "
"powerlessness, all the while doing everything he can to honor his vow and "
"protect Kvatch and its people."

"When Varen Aquilarios left the Gold Coast with the Second Legion to carry "
"his rebellion into the heart of Cyrodiil, he didn't leave his beloved "
"homeland completely unprotected. Between a slim wall that stretched from the "
"shores of the Abecean Sea to the banks of the Strid River and a surrogate "
"champion in the form of his nephew Carolus, Kvatch and the surrounding "
"countryside were spared both the retaliation of the Longhouse Emperor and "
"the degradations of the war that followed. But there were still plenty of "
"opportunities for the Wolf of Kvatch to take on the Imperial Dragon.\n"
"\n"
"Carolus Aquilarios idolized his uncle and was eager to help when Varen "
"declared open rebellion against the Emperor. In fact, Carolus wanted to join "
"Varen and fight alongside him as he marched toward the Imperial City. But "
"Varen had other plans for Carolus. He wanted someone he could trust to "

"Warders—the famed defenders of the city. Kvatch's defenders met the Imperial "
"forces on the plains below the city. The battle was short and fierce, ending "
"with the remnants of Anvil's forces—now greatly reduced—retreating back the "
"way they had come. The Wolf of Kvatch had repelled an attack by the Imperial "
"Dragon.\n"
"\n"
"Before the year was out, Anvil sent its dwindling Imperial troops against "
"Kvatch three more times, and each time they came away beaten and fewer than "
"they were before. Then, word reached the region that Varen Aquilarios had "
"ascended to the Ruby Throne. Carolus, who was being called the Wolf of "
"Kvatch for his bravery and leadership, officially inherited the title of "
"Count of Kvatch and took the wolf's head symbol as his own. \n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, Kvatch's good fortune wouldn't last long. As soon as Carolus "
"was officially named as Count of Kvatch, Artorius Ponticus, Primate of "
"Kvatch, began working to undermine the count's authority and carve out more "
"power and influence for himself. Always ambitious and powerful in his own "
"right as the religious authority of Cyrodiil, the Primate had a grudgingly "
"civil relationship with Varen, and had put aside his ambitions while Carolus "
"struggled to keep Kvatch safe. With the change in regime in the capital, "
"however, it appeared that the Primate sought a more influential position in "
"the city's hierarchy. Before this challenge could come to a head, however, "
"something significant occurred in Anvil.\n"
"\n"
"But that's a tale for another book."

"\n"
"The Gold Coast has undergone some radical changes since Varen Aquilarios led "
"his rebellion against the Longhouse Emperor Leovic in 2E 576. First, the "
"region's inhabitants banded together to build Varen's Wall, as discussed in "
"greater detail in my treatise of the same name. The protective boundary "
"basically separated the Gold Coast from the Colovian Highlands and served to "
"keep the area safe from Imperial retaliation and other external threats. "
"Second, the region took advantage of the rebellion to declare its "
"independence from Cyrodiil. These two events established the Gold Coast as "
"an isolated haven from the troubles that plague the rest of the "
"continent—but not without setting up challenges of a different sort.\n"
"\n"
"In 2E 577, just as the last stones were being placed to complete Varen's "
"Wall and the Imperial Navy was away dealing with the rebellion taking place "
"to the north and east, a fleet of merchant warships and pirate vessels "
"sailed into Anvil harbor. A white flag adorned with a red saber flew over "
"each ship. Led by Fortunata ap Dugal, a shipping magnate in the Gold Coast "
"Trading Company, the fleet took control of the docks and disembarked a "
"company of sailors and pirate warriors that quickly overpowered the "
"remaining troops loyal to the Imperial Prefect. In less than a day, "
"Fortunata had taken control of Anvil, named herself Provincial Governor, and "
"declared that the Gold Coast was now a free and independent state—from the "
"Abecean Sea to Varen's Wall.\n"
"\n"
"The self-proclaimed Provincial Governor, better known as the Pirate Queen to "
"friends and enemies alike, used her connections as a high-ranking merchant "
"lord of the Gold Coast Trading Company to build her base of power. She "
"promised the pirates a safe haven and a share of the wealth pouring through "
"the region in exchange for their backing and support. The pirates, along "
"with the merchant marines that had always been more loyal to Fortunata than "
"to the company that employed them, gave the Pirate Queen the weapons she "
"needed to take and maintain control of Anvil and the surrounding countryside."
"\n"
"\n"
"In many ways, the truth is almost more unbelievable than the risque and "
"outlandish adventure tales now appearing as broadsheets on the streets of "
"Anvil. These bawdy stories follow the exploits of the barely fictitious "
"Pirate Empress Thusa ap Lagud, and they've become quite popular. The actual "
"Pirate Queen tolerates the tales, if not actively encouraging their "
"publication on a regular basis. \n"
"\n"
"Now the blood-red sabers on fields of white fly above Castle Anvil and the "
"Anvil Lighthouse, and the Pirate Queen has turned Anvil into a \"\"Free City."
"\"\" No military vessels from any alliance are allowed to approach the Anvil "
"Docks. Instead, merchant ships from across Tamriel fill the wharfs, happy to "
"buy and sell cargo at bargain prices. Even the once-proud and influential "
"Gold Coast Trading Company has acquiesced to the Pirate Queen's demands, "
"deciding that profit is more important than arguing over respectability and "
"who's in charge. In effect, the company does what the Pirate Queen tells it "
"to.\n"
"\n"
"It doesn't take a prophet to predict that the Pirate Queen has her sights "
"set on Anvil's neighbor to the northeast, Kvatch. She said as much in her "
"much-publicized declaration of independence. With more and more pirates and "
"buccaneers rallying to her flag every day, and with gold flowing from "
"frightened nobles as protection money disguised as taxes, it's clear to see "
"that Fortunata will soon have the resources to deal with Count Carolus and "
"even Primate Artorius. It's just a matter of time. And the Pirate Queen has "
"demonstrated over and over again that she can be very patient when it comes "
"to letting her plans develop.\n"
"\n"
"By all accounts, Fortunata rules Anvil with an iron fist. The Red Sails "
"pirates serve as her private army, raiding, rampaging, and performing the "
"duties of enforcers whenever and wherever she directs them. She may be a "
"cruel and merciless dictator, but she keeps the region under control and "
"prevents anarchy from running rampant. Can we really expect more than that "
"from our rulers?"

"By Nonus Caprenius, Temporarily Unaffiliated Scholar of Imperial Antiquities\n"
"\n"
"No matter how many institutions of higher education expel me, no matter how "
"many publishers decline to print and distribute my theories, I refuse to "
"recant my position or change the topic of my research—not until minotaurs "
"have received the recognition and respect that they deserve!\n"
"\n"
"In the course of my research into the origins of the Empire, specifically "
"the rise and fall of the Alessian Order, I came across a wondrous thing. "
"Hidden in the background, often purposely obscured but still visible to "
"those of us who know what to look for, was an entire race of humanoids who "
"have been all but stricken from the historic record. This crime against "
"history must not stand, and I pledge to restore these creatures to their "
"proper place in the chronicle of the Empire.\n"
"\n"
"I'm referring, of course, to the maligned and misunderstood minotaur. These "
"humanoids with bodies that resemble humans and heads that resemble bulls "
"trace their lineage to Empress Alessia herself. While no period records "
"survive to state the truth of the situation, many ancient documents from "
"later periods speak of a relationship between the Slave-Queen and Kynareth's "
"son, Morihaus, whom the Divine sent to aid and advise Alessia. Often "
"depicted as a minotaur, the demigod Morihaus, I believe, gave rise to the "
"race through his dalliances with the Slave-Queen and the birth of her son, "
"Belharza the Man-Bull.\n"
"\n"
"Whatever the truth regarding the origins of the minotaurs, they began to "
"appear in greater and greater numbers in the years during and after Empress "
"Alessia's reign. I contend that the early minotaurs were as intelligent and "
"cultured in their own way as any Elf or Orc or Khajiit. Fiercely loyal to "
"the Empire, the minotaurs were among Empress Alessia's most devoted "
"defenders. Certain art and tomes from the time hint as much, but many of my "
"detractors want to know where the hard evidence is to back up my claims. "
"Unfortunately, much of that evidence was destroyed in the intervening period "
"while the mis-named Alessian Order held sway over the Empire.\n"
"\n"
"It was, after all, the Alessian Order that followed the rigorous Alessian "
"Doctrines. Of all the rules and regulations set forth by the Seventy-Seven "
"Inflexible Doctrines, the most notorious were those firmly opposed to the "
"Elves. I contend that the Order wasn't restricted to anti-Elven sentiment. I "
"believe its resentful followers applied the Doctrines to any non-human races "
"they felt like persecuting—including the minotaurs. One remaining fragment "
"of an ancient tablet, known as the Belharza Stone, shows what most scholars "
"agree is a section of a larger carving depicting Belharza the Man-Bull, "
"second Emperor of the Alessian Empire, facing down enemies. My own study of "
"the fragment tells a very different story.\n"
"\n"
"By the cut of their armor and the shape of their spears, I believe the so-"
"called enemies depicted in the carving are actually fanatical precursors of "
"Alessian troops. The spears, jabbed directly at the minotaur's heart, "
"indicate that these proto-Alessians killed or drove off the minotaurs, thus "
"beginning the decline of the race that we still see in evidence in the "
"current day. It's a shame what happened to the once-majestic race of bull-"
"men! But wait, I can hear my detractors already. They demand more "
"evidence—evidence that I fear was wiped out along with a hundred other "
"atrocities committed by the Alessian Order. But I do have one more fact to "
"consider, and it's evident to anyone willing to travel to specific sites and "
"watch the activity of the minotaurs from a safe distance.\n"
"\n"
"If you happen to study the minotaur in the wild, you'll find that they often "
"congregate at or near ancient sites of significance to the Empire. Why? I "
"contend it's because they have an instinctual memory of a time when they "
"were fierce defenders of the fledgling Empire. I contend that they are drawn "
"to such sites, compelled to continue to defend them despite the actions of "
"the Alessian Order that arose and all but destroyed these remarkable "
"creatures.\n"
"\n"
"Oh, scoff if you must. Go ahead. I've suffered worse. But take a moment and "
"at least consider what I've presented. Then ask yourself, why do the "
"minotaurs guard these ancient Imperial sites? Maybe in that question, you'll "
"come to appreciate the minotaurs—at least a little."

"By Exordor Vasidius, Sermonizer, Priest of Akatosh\n"
"\n"
"The Order of the Hour is one of the oldest knightly orders in the Empire. It "
"was born early in the life of the Empire, during the First Era, and "
"eventually faded into obscurity during the Second Era. It was founded by "
"Ennon Decan as an order of knights dedicated to Akatosh, though originally "
"it drew its members from the priesthood and military alike.\n"
"\n"
"The most recent incarnation of the Order of the Hour was established in 2E "
"432 by the warrior-priest of Akatosh, Cavor Merula, in response to the "
"collapse of the Second Empire and the coming of the Longhouse Emperors. "
"Fearing for the safety of the Dragon God priesthood and wanting to protect "
"the Cathedral of Akatosh and its many historic and religiously significant "
"treasures, Cavor gathered a few devoted and trusted fellow priests and "
"dedicated himself and his brothers to the defense of the Cathedral. On that "
"day, the Order of the Hour was reborn.\n"
"\n"
"Soon, devout soldiers and warrior-priests in service to Akatosh began to "
"flock to the Order's banner. The feared retribution against the Divines by "
"the Longhouse Emperors never materialized, however, and the Order of the "
"Hour transformed into a small but elite unit of bodyguards devoted to the "
"Cathedral and its resident Primate, the leader of the Akatosh faith. In many "
"ways, the Order of the Hour developed into a mostly ceremonial organization, "
"although they maintained their training and combat readiness. When the "
"occasional threat did strike from the shadows, the Order was prepared.\n"
"\n"
"Take, for example, the Kvatch bread riots of 2E 467. The common folk, "
"fearful and angry due to the red wheat blight that devastated crops for the "
"second year in a row, decided that Akatosh and his priests weren't doing "
"enough to rectify the situation. Gruff Bojour led an ax- and torch-bearing "
"mob to the very steps of the Cathedral, intent on inflicting violence and "
"making their displeasure known. But the Order of the Hour was ready for the "
"assault, and Sister Severa and her warrior-priests slaughtered half the "
"crowd before even a single torch had been thrown. The Primate promised to "
"pray to end the tribulation, and by the next season the blight had run its "
"course.\n"
"\n"
"Other examples of the bravery and dedication of the Order of the Hour exist, "
"including saving Primate Phrastus from an assassin's blade in 2E 540 and "
"rescuing a caravan of priests and pilgrims from bandits in 2E 561. The Order "
"has never wavered from its vow to serve and protect the Cathedral, and by "
"extension, the priests and worshipers who occupy the holy place.\n"
"\n"
"In 2E 480, a writ from the Primate of Akatosh authorized the Order to form "
"into an army during times of religious emergencies. Answering only to "
"religious authority, the militarized Order took to the walls of Kvatch to "
"protect the city from a horde of brigands led by the charismatic Orc "
"marauder, Baz Swordbreaker. Thanks to the efforts of the Order, the brigands "
"were defeated and the city saved. Immediately thereafter, the army disbanded "
"and the Order returned to its regular duties at the Cathedral.\n"
"\n"
"Recruits to the Order must be devout followers of Akatosh, unmarried so that "
"they may devote themselves fully to the Order and its intense regimens. "
"While the Order began as a small group of warrior-priests, the organization "
"has recently broadened its acceptance criteria so that non-clergy can "
"undertake the vows. Once indoctrinated into the Order, members undergo "
"enhanced training in combat and skills related to keeping the Cathedral safe."
"\n"
"\n"
"When the Gold Coast isolated itself from Cyrodiil after the Empire collapsed "
"and the Three Banners War began, Artorius Ponticus, Primate of Kvatch, "
"immediately set out to bolster the power and scope of the Order of the Hour. "
"He instructed Commander Marcus Scipio to increase the size of the Order and "
"set about expanding the Order's responsibilities beyond the boundaries of "
"the Cathedral and into the rest of the city of Kvatch. This was done, as the "
"Primate has said on numerous occasions, \"\"To reinforce the capabilities of "
"the Kvatch Guard in these dangerous and troubling times.\"\" As anyone can "
"plainly see, the Primate has only the best interests of Kvatch and its "
"people in mind.\n"
"\n"
"With recent threats against the city and the Cathedral, the Count of Kvatch "
"has granted the Primate of Akatosh emergency powers to once again convert "
"the Order into an army. Today, the Order of the Hour boasts the largest "
"force in the history of the organization. With a mix of devoted warrior-"
"priests and dedicated soldiers of faith filling its growing ranks, the Order "
"now maintains the safety and keeps the peace of not only the Cathedral of "
"Akatosh's grounds, but of all of Kvatch as well. No matter how chaotic "
"things get on the other side of Varen's Wall, on the Kvatch side, the Order "
"has things well in hand."

"\n"
"Hastily constructed during the early stages of Varen Aquilarios's rebellion "
"against the last of the Longhouse Emperors, the structure known as Varen's "
"Wall separates the Gold Coast from the Colovian Highlands. Allow me to "
"elucidate the wall and its importance to the region, the rebellion, and the "
"ongoing strife personified by the Three Banners War.\n"
"\n"
"Shortly after the start of Varen's Rebellion, Aquilarios ordered his "
"followers to begin construction of a wall to protect Kvatch and the rest of "
"the Gold Coast from retaliation by the Longhouse Emperor and his troops. "
"Aquilarios, determined to take the battle to the heart of the Empire, didn't "
"want to leave his home and original seat of power open to retribution by his "
"enemies in his absence. He enlisted the famed engineer Jaros Truptor to "
"design and oversee the project, ordering him to build a strong, tall defense "
"in record time. \n"
"\n"
"With a cadre of paid workers and an ever-growing army of eager volunteers, "
"Jaros set about the task at hand. Deciding that speed and solid construction "
"were more important than any aesthetic values, Jaros designed a relatively "
"simple plan that allowed for the use of whatever building materials his "
"workers were able to scavenge from the surrounding countryside. Natural rock "
"and stone, pieces of ruined structures, purchased building supplies—even "
"parts scavenged from the estates dotting the countryside— all were gathered "
"for use in raising Varen's Wall.\n"
"\n"
"Jaros's design of the wall itself was simple, utilitarian, and not anywhere "
"near as visually appealing as the other projects he's known for. The wall "
"was a mix of rough-hewn stone, mismatched rocks, blocks commandeered from "
"the estates of willing and unwilling donors, and even the natural contours "
"of the land itself. Towers rose from the wall in a more or less regular "
"pattern, breaking up the expanse of stone and providing locations for "
"guards, watchmen, or even garrisons of soldiers to congregate along the "
"defended border. \n"
"\n"
"Due to Varen's popularity among the common folk of Kvatch and Anvil "
"Counties, Jaros was able to form a volunteer work crew that provided him "
"with more than enough workers to keep construction going day and night. But "
"popularity alone didn't inspire the people to donate their time and effort. "
"It was Varen's words and deeds that accomplished that. He convinced the "
"people that his rebellion was not only just, it was necessary to stop the "
"Daedra-worshiping Emperor Leovic. In addition, he rallied the people to help "
"defend themselves and their land, and within a year Varen's Wall stretched "
"from the shores of the Abecean Sea, winding its way through the countryside "
"southwest of the Colovian Highlands, eventually terminating at the Strid "
"River.\n"
"\n"
"As important as Varen's Wall was to protecting the region during Varen's "
"Rebellion, it has played an even greater role since the fall of the Empire "
"and the start of the Three Banners War. As the war for Cyrodiil rages on, "
"Varen's Wall has protected the counties of Kvatch and Anvil from the worst "
"fallout of the ongoing battles taking place at what was once the heart of "
"the shattered Empire. It has created a kind of safe harbor in which the "
"people of the Gold Coast have thrived. In some ways, it has become a sort of "
"political experiment to see whether the law and order typified by Kvatch and "
"the Cathedral of Akatosh or the more chaotic nature of Anvil and its "
"collection of pirates and smugglers will win out as the ultimate power in "
"the area."

"\"\"Lord Akatosh, lend us your might! Lord Akatosh, grant us your light!\"\"\n"
"—A popular prayer to Akatosh the Dragon God\n"
"\n"
"If there is a single Divine who holds dominion over the Gold Coast, it has "
"to be Akatosh, the Dragon God of Time. From the grand Cathedral of Akatosh "
"in Kvatch and radiating outward, the word of Akatosh and his servants "
"spreads the light and the truth of the Dragon God in all directions.\n"
"\n"
"Reputed to be the first and greatest of the Eight Divines and the first of "
"the gods to form in the Beginning Place, Akatosh watches over the land and "
"its people with a singular ferocity, never shirking in his role as the God-"
"defender of the Empire—even while the Empire lies broken and shattered. As "
"the Primate of Kvatch likes to say at every opportunity, \"\"The Dragon God "
"sees beyond the concerns of the day and contemplates the entire expanse of "
"time. The current situation is merely a minor disturbance in the flow of "
"events, and Akatosh has everything well in hand.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Akatosh promotes three key qualities in his sphere: endurance, "
"invincibility, and everlasting legitimacy. Perhaps that's why the Empire was "
"so quick to embrace the Dragon God and his tenets. In the words of the "
"Primate of Kvatch, here are the ways in which Akatosh embodies the three key "
"qualities.\n"
"\n"
"Endurance: \"\"This quality represents Akatosh's ability and strength to "
"continue or last and is directly tied to his role as the God of Time. "
"Akatosh endures, and so do the true believers who have accepted his words "
"and devoted themselves to his teachings. Despite fatigue, regardless of "
"stress or adverse conditions, Akatosh and his followers carry on. This is "
"the Dragon God's lasting quality.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Invincibility: \"\"Akatosh cannot be conquered, defeated, or subdued—and "
"neither can those who believe in and honor the Dragon God. This is the "
"Dragon God's indomitable quality.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Everlasting Legitimacy: \"\"This quality must be examined in all its parts. "
"It represents not only Akatosh's eternal aspect, but his reverence for law, "
"reason, and the ruling principles of hereditary right. Nothing blessed and "
"sanctioned by Akatosh can be considered spurious or unjustified. This is the "
"Dragon God's continuing and lawful quality.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Beyond these basic tenets, the Primate of Kvatch and his priests preach the "
"five commands of Akatosh to faithful and faithless alike.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Serve and obey your Emperor.\"\" Since its inception, the Empire and "
"Akatosh worship have gone hand in hand, as this command clearly exemplifies.\n"

"\"\"Study the Covenants.\"\" These written agreements between Akatosh and "
"his mortal followers, such as Alessia and her descendents, serve as tokens "
"of their joined blood and pledged faith. All followers are urged to read and "
"understand these eternal contracts.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Worship the Eight.\"\" But Akatosh is not a jealous god. He expects his "
"followers to pay tribute not just to himself, but to his fellow Divines.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Do your duty.\"\" Duty and responsibility figure prominently in the "
"teachings of the rule-loving Dragon God. Failure to fulfill your obligations "
"is a sin in the eyes of Akatosh.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Heed the commands of the saints and priests.\"\" Akatosh favors "
"hierarchy and structure, so it comes as no surprise that he demands that his "
"followers comply with the orders of the saints and priests. \n"
"\n"
"The Primate of Kvatch often declares, \"\"As Akatosh wills it, so shall it "
"be.\"\" For the Dragon God of Time embodies yesterday, today, and tomorrow, "
"and he embraces the rules that keep the world ordered and precise. By "
"honoring Akatosh with devotion and worship, his followers endeavor to do the "
"same."

"I have had it up to here with the rogues and hoodlums that have turned our "
"once great city of Kvatch into a cesspool of crime and depravity. And do you "
"know who the worst of the bad bunch happens to be? It's not the smugglers or "
"the bandits or the pirates. It's that nest of vipers, that cult of secrets "
"pretending to be a legitimate business. Oh, some of you have heard whispers, "
"and some of you know the legends, but only I have learned the whole, gory "
"truth! And now I plan to expose these brutal fanatics to the bright light of "
"day! Dark Brotherhood, prepare to be revealed as the cowardly murderers you "
"really are!\n"

"I discovered this unfinished letter among my brother's papers, along with a "

"religious ascetics who sell their dark talents to the highest bidder. While "
"I can't prove it beyond a shadow of a doubt, there is no uncertainty in my "
"own mind about the fate of my brother. He didn't die from eating a rotten "

"Oh dear. First my brother-in-law. Now my husband. Who knew the men in their "
"family were so fragile, so prone to dying at an early age? But maybe there's "
"more to what happened to the two brothers than the obvious conclusion. We're "
"supposed to believe that two virile and healthy men in the prime of their "
"lives simply keeled over and died while working at their writing tables? "
"I've studied the letter they both began to write, reviewed the damning "
"journal with its tales of murder-for-hire and dark rituals conducted in the "

"I've read it all, and there's only one conclusion I can come to. My husband "

"paid killers operating on the Gold Coast! And anyone who tells you "
"differently will probably wind up just like my beloved husband and his no-"
"account brother. So, to anyone who might read this, I'm burning the journal "
"and putting all of this murder nonsense behind me.\n"
