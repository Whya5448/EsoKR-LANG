"'Twas in Menevia, dear, green Menevia, there dwelt a young Breton of family "
"and name. He had inherited a patrimony, and thus needed to do nothing, as "
"others were paid to do for him. And so he sat at his mullioned window and "
"gazed out the diamond panes at the colors of the countryside as they changed "
"with the light. And he dreamed away the day, until the colors darkened and "
"he betook himself to bed, where he slumbered and dreamed in truth.\n"
"\n"
"Of what did he dream? He dreamed of his own land, but in colors more "
"intense, more true, and more pure than in day. His Menevia of Dreams was "
"more real than his Menevia of Waking, and he felt more alive when asleep "
"than awake. Each day at his mullions, he looked and longed for a way to "
"dream beyond dreams—a way to live in his Reverie-Menevia forever and forever."
"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Reverie-Menevia,\"\" he said, and it was a prayer. \"\"Reverie-Menevia. "
"Reverie-Menevia.\"\" A thousand, thousand times he uttered this prayer, and "
"it changed like a dream to \"\" 'Ver'-Menevia, 'ver'-Menevia,\"\" and more "
"and more it became less and less, until at last, \"\"Vaermina,\"\" he said, "
"and \"\"Vaermina,\"\" and  \"\"Vaermina\"\" again.\n"
"\n"
"And to him she came in Dream-Form, Vaermina Herself, and called him Supernal "
"Dreamer, and First Nightcaller, and named him Omen of a Hundred Prophecies. "
"And when he awoke, he yet did dream, and spoke as in a dream, and called "
"other dreamers to him, and to Reverie-Menevia.\n"
"\n"
"And soon you shall join him. The Nightcaller has dreamed it. One night you "
"shall dream, and in your dream you will say the Name. And She will come."

"A new year, and a new start. Sirune agreed to be my betrothed last night! "
"I'm the luckiest mer in Mathiisen. I've already made arrangements with "
"Yondin to use the forge. I'm going to melt down my father's old blade and "
"use it as the base for a Ring of Mara. Mathiisen steel is good enough for "
"the troops, right? It will be good enough for my true heart.\n"
"\n"
"3rd Sun's Dawn: \n"
"The Heralds are shouting in every square across the island. There's a new "
"Queen! And we're now part of some kind of Alliance—with the Wood Elves and "
"the Khajiit, of all people. \"\"The Aldmeri Dominion,\"\" they're calling it."
" I couldn't be prouder, but father has done nothing but grumble. He says "
"letting \"\"those kind of folk\"\" onto the island will be bad for business.\n"
"\n"
"10th Sun's Dawn: \n"
"Sirune and I sneaked out in the middle of the night and made for Skywatch. "
"It was so exciting, bedding down by the side of the road. Like we're in the "
"Fighters Guild! The handbills telling of the parade have been all over the "
"island, and we decided we couldn't let something like this pass us by. I'll "
"be thrice-cursed by the old mer, I know it. But damn him for a fool. Miss a "
"chance to see the Queen, the Mane, and the Bosmer Treethanes? Not on your "
"life.\n"
"\n"
"11th Sun's Dawn: \n"
"If today was any indication, Father was right. The parade was amazing, with "
"Her Majesty leading a phalanx of Marines up the path to the gates. Then came "
"the Treethanes, with their wily jungle rangers. Vinedusk, I think someone "
"said? And then the Mane, with those braids! Amazing to see the Khajiiti "
"warriors on display.\n"
"\n"
"Much more pleasing than the furry sneak-thief I caught with his hand in my "
"coin-purse. I tried to catch him before he made off, but he dove between "
"some of those damned dock workers who were so obsessed with their frog races "
"they didn't even look up. And then he was gone. Sirune said it was all "
"right, that we'd just leave earlier than we'd planned. Damn it. Just hate to "
"let her down.\n"
"\n"
"17th Sun's Dawn: \n"
"Damn them all! Everything has been a mess since Sirune and I came back from "
"Skywatch. Father was furious that we'd left, and when I told him how many "
"coins that cat took … old bastard hasn't beaten me like that since I was "
"learning the forge. \n"
"\n"
"Then, a few days ago, they pulled all of us into the forgemaster's office. "
"Condalin had gotten word that, with the new alliance, tradesmer can start "
"hiring some of \"\"those folk.\"\" Tossing a certain number of jobs to "
"\"\"them\"\" would net you extra coin from the Thalmor. \n"
"\n"
"And so he dropped father's contract! Been with the forge for decades, and "
"now cat-men and cannibals are doing the job. All because of this damned "
"alliance. Father's beside himself, about the steel more than anything. Says "
"they won't know how to cure it right. Stars above, what's happening?\n"

"2nd First Seed: \n"
"My life is ruined. I'm on the run, and everyone I knew and loved hates me. "
"Damn the \"\"Dominion\"\" and our smiling Queen to boot!\n"
"\n"
"It all started when that recruiter for the Battlereeve came to town. He was "
"looking for volunteers for the Dominion military. When no one came forward, "
"he said he'd been empowered to take conscripts. He tapped me and Sirune's "
"brother. He also grabbed the twins, Taleril and Tanaril. Shoved us into a "
"line with a gang of others and started us down the road.\n"
"\n"
"We weren't a mile before Tanaril snapped. Went crazy, screaming about how he "
"couldn't fight Dark Elves, that they use your body to hatch spiders in. He "
"made a break for it, and a bunch of us used the chance to run as well.\n"
"\n"
"I'm holed up in a cave near Silsailen. My father is penniless. My bride-to-"
"be will soon think me a traitor. The damned cats and runty Elves are taking "
"over the island, and the military is putting children on the front lines. "
"This isn't the homeland I grew up in!\n"
"\n"
"5th First Seed: \n"
"I was reduced to trying to steal something for my evening meal, and—of "
"course—I was caught. I slipped into Silsailen after dusk, the smell of some "
"delicious whitefish wafting on the breeze. I hadn't eaten anything "
"worthwhile since the morning the recruiter came into town, when I had that "
"delicious spiced bread Sirune's mother made. \n"
"\n"
"I slipped into town and tracked the smell to the local inn. I was trying to "
"figure out how to get into the kitchen when a big beefy hand fell on my "
"shoulder. One of the Canonreeve's men. He knew exactly what I was doing, "
"almost like he'd been watching me since I got into town. Now I'm sitting in "
"a cell underneath the reeve's manse, waiting his justice. At least they let "
"me keep the journal here.\n"
"\n"
"Damn you, Ayrenn! Damn you, Dominion!\n"
"\n"
"10th First Seed: \n"
"My old life is over. And my new life under the Veil has begun. It turns out "
"the Canonreeve himself, an honorable man named Valano, has experienced his "
"own doubts about his future under the Dominion. He used to be a good friend "
"to the Queen, even, but worries now the years have changed her.\n"
"\n"
"Valano is a member of a group called the Veiled Heritance. They're a group "
"of freedom fighters, willing to do what has to be done. They're willing to "
"make the hard choices, and stop the spread of foreign influence on our soil. "
"\n"
"\n"
"I was brought up out of that cellar below Silsailen thinking I was going to "
"do hard labor. Instead, I found a new family. Valano said he knew all about "
"my problems, even knew that I'd been taken by a Dominion recruiter. Said "
"that he was willing to help, and help me help myself.\n"

"As a member in high standing, I feel it necessary to explain and extirpate "
"the notion that Kinlord Rilis the XII is somehow a founder of the Mages "
"Guild. The common folk believe that the kinlord, in the days before his "
"cruelty and sadism became well-known, brokered a deal that reigned in "
"\"\"dangerous mages\"\" and somehow put binders in place to keep the "
"commonalty safe. This is simply not the case. \n"
" \n"
"Vanus Galerion, student of Iachesis, did indeed flout prevailing thought "
"when it came to magical experimentation in large cities. He drew together "
"numerous students and artificers to the city of Firsthold. For the first "
"time, he sought to prove the benefit of spellcasters working in close "
"proximity. Not for a mighty ritual, but for study, experimentation, and a "
"sense of camaraderie.\n"
" \n"
"This simple premise so terrified the people of Firsthold that they turned to "
"their ruler, Kinlord Rilis the XII. Now known by many less polite titles, "
"Rilis was first and foremost a political animal. He saw in \"\"Galerion's "
"Folly,\"\" as it was known at the time, a chance to play the mages and "

"The much-speculated-upon \"\"Charter Conclave\"\" brought together Rilis, "
"Iachesis, Galerion, and other notables from across the Isles and the Psijic "
"Order. By common agreement, it is true, no records were kept of that meeting."
" But mark my words here, adept: Rilis allowed the meeting, allowed Galerion "
"to do what he did, to further his own ends.\n"
" \n"
"In retrospect, of course, the legacy of Artaeum is the proud heritage of the "
"new Mages Guild. We now boldly gather together under the Guild banner, and "
"will no doubt do so for many centuries to come. Just let it be remembered: "
"Rilis the Twelfth was a dangerous mer. Even at the time of the Conclave, he "
"trafficked with dark powers and made pacts with Daedra. \n"

"Loyal citizens of Auridon! I have the pleasure of being an advisor to Her "
"Royal Majesty, Queen Ayrenn the First, Eagle Primarch of the Aldmeri "
"Dominion, High Queen of the Summerset Isles, Overfriend of the Royal Camoran "
"House of the Wood Elven people, and boon companion to the Mane of the "
"Khajiit.\n"
"\n"
"As Royal Advisor, I have penned this brief account of Queen Ayrenn's life "
"and history. Read, that you might welcome our Queen into your hearts.\n"
"\n"
"Her Majesty spent her early days as many children do in the Isles. She "
"trained in blades beside her father. She rode horses in the surf along our "
"golden beaches. And she memorized history and sonnets beneath soft pink "
"petals.\n"
"\n"
"Over twenty years ago, your forward-thinking King—His Royal Majesty, King "
"Hidellith of Alinor, may he be ever honored in Aetherius—gathered with the "
"royal family at the Crystal Tower in celebration of Her Majesty's passage "
"into the Labyrinth. This time of intensive study had been required by all "
"Summerset rulers in the past, and Her Majesty was to step into that period "
"with arms wide. As the hour approached, however, the then-princess was found "
"missing!\n"
"\n"
"While a long search was begun, in truth, Her Majesty had claimed her own "
"destiny. Her Majesty had stolen away to the Isle of Balfiera to live with "
"the Direnni at the Adamant Tower. The members of that clan trained her in "
"the art of war. They turned her simple noble swordplay to lithe and seasoned "
"blade-dancing. Her beachside rides became forced marches on horseback, and "
"her singing of sonnets beneath the trees of her homeland gave way to the "
"study of the arts most arcane.\n"
"\n"
"Much has been made of our Queen's adventures in Tamriel by bards and common "
"broadsheet scribes. Yes, it's true that she once rode a bear. That she "
"hunted the frost trolls of Skyrim, delved into the depths of a Dwarven ruin, "
"and crewed with a pirate captain of Cyrodiil. Her Majesty once flew upon an "
"enormous kite on the winds of the Alik'r Desert, and danced with nereids in "
"the Illessan Hills. These adventures were not the larks of a wanton, but "
"instead a deliberate process. The tempering of a blade!\n"
"\n"
"And when His Majesty King Hidellith passed away, when it looked as though "
"our remote isles would be left to flounder in the swell of history, Princess "
"Ayrenn returned! Her Majesty plucked the crown from where it had fallen in "
"the dust. She took up her father's sword and led us out into the world.\n"
"\n"
"Led us into the world to find new allies waiting just off our shores! The "
"Queen's connections to the noble Wood Elves and fierce Khajiit enabled us to "
"form the mighty Dominion that now stands astride our corner of Tamriel, "
"poised to strike at the dark heart of Cyrodiil and ward off the depredations "
"of the warmongering alliances of the north.\n"
"\n"
"Though she has her detractors and cowards defame her courage from behind a "
"veil, Queen Ayrenn is the living, beating heart of the Dominion. Our fortune "

"\n"
"The Eight\n"
"\n"
"(though few Altmer outside the Empire accept the limitation of Divines to "
"eight):\n"
"\n"
"Auri-El (King of the Aldmer):\n"
"\n"
"The Elven Akatosh is Auri-El. Auri-El is the soul of Anui-El, who, in turn, "
"is the soul of Anu the Everything. He is the chief of most Aldmeri pantheons."
" Most Altmeri and Bosmeri claim direct descent from Auri-El. In his only "
"known moment of weakness, he agreed to take his part in the creation of the "
"mortal plane, that act which forever sundered the Elves from the spirit "
"worlds of eternity. To make up for it, Auri-El led the original Aldmer "
"against the armies of Lorkhan in mythic times, vanquishing that tyrant and "
"establishing the first kingdoms of the Altmer, Altmora and Old Ehlnofey. He "
"then ascended to heaven in full observance of his followers so that they "
"might learn the steps needed to escape the mortal plane.\n"
"\n"
"Magnus (Magus):\n"
"\n"
"The god of sorcery, Magnus withdrew from the creation of the world at the "
"last second, though it cost him dearly. What is left of him on the world is "
"felt and controlled by mortals as magic. One story says that, while the idea "
"was thought up by Lorkhan, it was Magnus who created the schematics and "
"diagrams needed to construct the mortal plane. He is sometimes represented "
"by an astrolabe, a telescope, or, more commonly, a staff.\n"
"\n"
"Trinimac:\n"
"\n"
"Strong god of the early Aldmer, in some places more popular than Auri-El. He "
"was a warrior spirit of the original Elven tribes that led armies against "
"the Men. Boethiah is said to have assumed his shape (in some stories, he "
"even eats Trinimac) so that he could convince a throng of Aldmer to listen "
"to him, which led to their eventual Chimeri conversion. Trinimac vanishes "
"from the mythic stage after this, to return as the dread Malacath (Altmeri "
"propaganda portrays this as the dangers of Dunmeri influence).\n"
"\n"
"Y'ffre (God of the Forest):\n"
"\n"
"While Auri-El Time Dragon might be the king of the gods, Y'ffre is revered "
"as the spirit of \"\"the now.\"\" According to the Elves, after the creation "
"of the mortal plane everything was in chaos. The first mortals were turning "
"into plants and animals and back again. Then Y'ffre transformed himself into "
"the first of the Ehlnofey, or \"\"Earth Bones.\"\" After these laws of "
"nature were established, mortals had a semblance of safety in the new world, "
"because they could finally understand it.\n"
"\n"
"Xarxes:\n"
"\n"
"Xarxes is the god of ancestry and secret knowledge. He began as a scribe to "
"Auri-El, and has kept track of all Aldmeri accomplishments, large and small, "
"since the beginning of time. He created his wife, Oghma, from his favorite "
"moments in history.\n"
"\n"
"Mara (Goddess of Love):\n"
"\n"
"Nearly universal goddess. Origins started in mythic times as a fertility "
"goddess. She is sometimes associated with Nir of the \"\"Anuad,\"\" the "
"female principle of the cosmos that gave birth to creation. For the Altmer, "
"she is the wife of Auri-El.\n"
"\n"
"Stendarr (God of Mercy):\n"
"\n"
"God of compassion and righteous rule. In early Altmeri legends, Stendarr is "
"the apologist of Men.\n"
"\n"
"Syrabane (Warlock's God):\n"
"\n"
"An Aldmeri god-ancestor of magic, Syrabane aided Bendu Olo in the Fall of "
"the Sload. Through judicious use of his magical ring, Syrabane saved many "
"from the scourge of the Thrassian Plague. He is also called the Apprentices' "
"God, for he is a favorite of the younger members of the Mages Guild.\n"
"\n"
"— Additional Deities with Significant Altmer Cults —\n"
"\n"
"Phynaster:\n"
"\n"
"Hero-god of the Summerset Isles, who taught the Altmer how to naturally live "
"another hundred years by using a shorter walking stride.\n"
"\n"
"Lorkhan (The Missing God):\n"
"\n"
"This Creator-Trickster-Tester deity is in every Tamrielic mythic tradition. "
"His most popular name is the Aldmeri \"\"Lorkhan,\"\" or Doom Drum. He "
"convinced or contrived the Original Spirits to bring about the creation of "
"the mortal plane, upsetting the status quo—much like his father Padomay had "
"introduced instability into the universe in the Beginning Place. After the "
"world is materialized, Lorkhan is separated from his divine center, "
"sometimes involuntarily, and wanders the creation of the et'Ada. He and his "
"metaphysical placement in the \"\"scheme of things\"\" is interpreted a "
"variety of ways. To the High Elves, he is the most unholy of all higher "
"powers, as he forever broke their connection to the spirit plane. In the "
"legends, he is almost always an enemy of the Aldmer and, therefore, a hero "
"of early Mankind."

"The reasons why the Daedra are reviled and their worship forbidden among all "
"the civilized races of Tamriel are well understood, and as this series of "
"papers will show, are grounded in historical events. The opinions of the so-"
"called academic who styles herself \"\"Lady Cinnabar\"\" notwithstanding, "
"the evidence supporting my assertions is incontrovertible and generally "
"accepted by all accredited scholars of antiquity.\n"
"\n"
"The Aldmeri, who'd been first to begin organized worship of the Aedra, were "
"also the first to venerate the Daedra Lords. This probably began on a small "
"scale among the Ayleids, those Elves who left the Summerset Isles to create "
"splinter cultures in central and southwest Tamriel—in some cases "
"specifically to evade the strictures of Aldmeri regulation, which forbade "
"(among many other things) the worship of Daedra. \n"
"\n"
"As Ayleid culture flourished, drawing ever further from Alinor, in the last "
"millennium of the Merethic Era Daedric worship took hold and spread among "
"the Heartland High Elves. The Aedra were still widely revered, with probably "
"a majority of the Ayleids continuing to pay them homage, but cults devoted "
"to the various Daedric Princes sprang up across Cyrodiil, tolerated and then "
"celebrated. Unlike the Chimer, the Ayleids made no distinction between "
"\"\"good and bad\"\" Daedra—indeed, even some of the more heinous Princes "
"received mass veneration, especially when their worship was adopted and "
"endorsed by Ayleid kings and aristocrats. \n"
"\n"
"Widespread Daedra worship among the Heartland Elves was particularly ill "
"news for the tribes of Nedic humans who were then arriving in Tamriel. The "
"Ayleids enslaved the immigrant tribes of Men, at first occasionally but then "
"systematically, and the Nedic people found themselves subject to masters "
"who, in many cases, worshiped the Princes—including those who encouraged "
"slavery, domination, and cruelty. Under the Ayleids, the human thralls found "
"themselves the subjects of such Daedra-inspired \"\"arts\"\" as flesh-"
"sculpture and gut-gardening. In fact, the revulsion for Daedra-worship that "
"pervades most human cultures in Tamriel probably originated in this period.\n"
"\n"
"The Alessian slave-revolt of the early First Era was largely fueled by "
"desperate rage against the Ayleids' Daedra-inspired cruelty. The Ayleid "
"kings who aligned themselves with the rebellion were largely Aedra-"
"worshipers, which in part explains why, once the Ayleids were overthrown, "
"Queen Alessia incorporated the leading Elven Aedra into the First Empire's "
"worship of the Eight Divines. Her new Empire of Cyrodiil outlawed the "
"worship of the Daedric Princes, and Daedra-worshiping Ayleids were "
"exterminated wherever they were found.\n"
"\n"
"Thus, by the middle of the First Era, large-scale Daedra-worship was extinct "
"in central Tamriel, surviving only among the Chimer in the northeast of the "
"continent, and among the Orcs (ever a pariah people) who worshiped Malacath "
"(or Mauloch) as their god-ancestor. Elsewhere, among Men, Mer, and Beast-"
"Peoples, Daedra-worship survived only at the level of cults which were more-"
"or-less forbidden. Lady Cinnabar's assertions to the contrary are so much "

"\n"
"By Sathyr Longleat\n"
"\n"
"Bravil is one of the most charming towns in Cyrodiil, sparkling in her "
"simple beauty, illustrious by her past. No visit to the southern part of the "
"Imperial Province is complete without a walk along Bravil's exciting river "
"port, a talk with her friendly native children, and, of course, in the "
"tradition of the village, a whispered word to the famous statue of the Lucky "
"Old Lady.\n"
"\n"
"Many thousands of years before the arrival of the Atmorans, the native "
"Ayleid people had long lived in the vicinity of modern day Bravil. The Niben "
"then, as now, provided food and transportation, and the village was even "
"more populous than it is today. We are not certain what they called their "
"region: as insular as they were, the word they used would be translated to "
"simply mean \"\"home.\"\" These savage Ayleids were so firmly entrenched "
"that the Bravil region was one of the very last areas to be liberated by the "
"Alessian army in the second century of the First Era. Though little remains "
"of that era culturally or archeologically, thank Mara, the tales of "
"debauchery and depravity have entered into the realm of legends.\n"
"\n"
"How the Ayleids were able to survive such a long siege is debated by "
"scholars to this day. All, however, grant the honor of the victory to one of "
"the Empress Alessia's centurions, a man called Teo Bravillius Tasus, the man "
"for whom the modern town is named.\n"
"\n"
"It was said he invaded the village no less than four times, after heavy "
"resistance, but each time upon the morning dawning, all his soldiery within "
"would be dead, murdered. By the time more centuria had arrived, the "
"fortified town was repopulated with Ayleids. After the second successful "
"invasion, secret underground tunnels were found and filled in, but once "
"again, come morning, the soldiers were again dead, and the citizens had "
"returned. After the third successful siege, legions were posted outside of "
"the town, watching the roads and riverway for signs of attacks, but no one "
"came. The next morning, the bodies of the invading soldiers were thrown from "
"the parapets of town's walls.\n"
"\n"
"Teo Bravillius Tasus knew that the Ayleids must be hiding themselves "
"somewhere in the town, waiting until nightfall, and then murdering the "
"soldiers while they slept. The question was where. After the fourth "
"invasion, he himself led the soldiers in a thorough inspection of every "
"corner, every shadow. Just as they were ready to give up, the great "
"centurion noticed two curious things. High in the sheer walls of the town, "
"beyond anyone's ability to climb, there were indentations, narrow platforms. "
"And by the river just inside the town, he discovered a single footprint from "
"someone clearly not wearing the Imperial boot.\n"
"\n"
"The Ayleids, it seemed, had taken two routes to hide themselves. Some had "
"levitated up to the walls and hidden themselves high above, and others had "
"slipped into the river, where they were able to breathe underwater. It was a "
"relatively easy task once the strange Elves' even stranger hiding holes had "
"been discovered to rout them out, and see to it that there were no more "
"midnight assassinations of the Empress's troops.\n"
"\n"
"It may seem beyond belief that an entire community could be so skilled in "
"these spells hundreds and hundreds of years before the Mages Guild was "
"formed to teach the ways of magicka to the common folk. There does, however, "
"appear to be evidence that, just as the Psijics on the Isle of Artaeum "
"developed Mysticism long before there was a name for it, the even more "
"obscure Ayleids of southern Cyrodiil had developed what was to be known as "
"the School of Alteration. It is not, after all, much of a stretch when one "
"considers that other Ayleids at the time of Bravil's conquering and even "
"later were shapeshifters. The community of pre-Bravil could not turn into "
"beasts and monsters, but they could alter their bodies to hide themselves "
"away. A related and useful skill, to be sure. But not so effective to save "
"themselves in the end."

"No Mer escaped their axes once seen, no settlement remained unburnt in their "

"treacherous Elves. As they journeyed, so the terror of them grew among the "

"\n"
"Gurilda led her crew to the foothills of a lofty range of mountains. These "

"finally a way was found, the crew crossed over and into a new land. \"\"The "

"flowing rivers. In the name of Fallowfire, their lost Companions, and Yngol, "
"they scoured the land, burning Mer villages and putting all they encountered "
"to the axe.\n"
"\n"
"Finally, the Mer offered battle. The cowardly Elves gathered in great "
"numbers high atop a rocky hill, daring Gurilda's Companions to attack. And "
"so they did. Challenges were offered, brave deeds were done, and heroes made."
" Battle raged through the day and as the sun touched the peaks of the "
"western mountains, the Mer broke and fled. Gurilda lay dying, pierced by a "
"multitude of weapons, but lived until sunset. Her spirit ascended to "
"Sovngarde knowing her crew was victorious.\n"
"\n"
"That day, the dominion of Elves over the Rift was ended. The Companions "
"claimed the land in the name of Ysgramor, Harbinger of us all, and made it "
"free to all Nords. To honor their dead, the Companions labored long, delving "
"into the hillside to craft a tomb. Gurilda was buried there, with all her "
"weapons and armor. There too were placed the remains of Bergitte the "
"Toothless and Kajord Eagle-Eye, laid alongside Gurilda as they had fallen in "
"battle, defending their captain. Others of the honored dead were entombed as "

"Vikord One-Ear, long Gurilda's first mate but now captain, gazed long upon "
"the hills rising about them and the valleys at their feet. This was a land "
"he could love, where his people could prosper and grow. He decreed the "

"There's a reason I was kicked out of Daggerfall, chased out of Elden Root, "

"ale, and Argonian swill this world has to offer. I've sampled skooma with "
"Khajiit, licked an Argonian Hist Tree, and hunted \"\"magical\"\" toads with "
"the Bosmer.\n"
"\n"
"None of that compares to Nord mead. There's nothing like it.\n"
"\n"
"The purest stuff is made in Nord villages, but we're at war with the Nords, "
"and a Breton has no guarantee of surviving a trip like that. Leave that sort "
"of thing to the professionals. There is still hope, however. If you're ever "
"at a tavern, and there's a cask of Nord mead, you'd be a fool to pass it up.\n"
"\n"
"Mead is made by fermenting honey and water (though a few recipes call for "
"molasses). Sometimes, you add grain mash and strain it, but that isn't "
"necessary. Some of the High Elves call it \"\"honey wine,\"\" but mead needs "
"more than good honey. Every meadery has its own recipes. After you drink "
"enough mead, you learn the names of the brewmasters who create them. A drunk "
"Nord will gladly punch another in the face over the honor of a good "
"brewmaster. Then again, a drunk Nord will punch anyone for just about "
"anything.\n"
"\n"
"Every brewmaster has a distinct blend of spices, fruit, and sometimes hops "
"(which makes a mead bitter, which makes some Nords bitter, too). I've even "
"heard tales of mead mixed with the blood of heroes, allegedly granting them "
"the words of a poet or skald. I'd like a mead named after me, but I'm not "
"going to bleed for it.\n"
"\n"
"An Altmer once told me that brewing is the basis of all culture. It's why "
"our ancestors started farming and forming cities. It's what we do when we've "
"got too much wheat and barley and hops and we're sick of farming. The "
"culture of drinking seems to be what keeps Nords together.\n"
"\n"
"Nords must be really sick of farming, because they brew and drink prodigious "
"amounts of mead. Whenever a cask of really good mead is opened, Nords gather "
"round because they know that cask won't last long. But if you don't know how "
"to behave in the Nord drinking culture, you'll end up broke, broken, "
"hungover, and helpless. I found out the hard way.\n"
"\n"
"Nords love to drink. But more than that. Nords respect those who can endure "
"adversity. I know that sounds flowery for explaining why two drunk Nords "
"would have a \"\"hit-me-hard-in-the-face\"\" contest, but really, that's why "
"their culture celebrates getting drunk.\n"
"\n"
"A Nord can gain respect by consuming more mead than anyone else, just as "
"he's respected for surviving a blizzard or killing a bear with a sharp stick."
" \"\"Nord honor\"\" is something they talk about endlessly when they're "
"drunk, and even more when they're sober. So the first thing you learn about "
"Nords is if you want their respect, never turn down a drink. It's a test. If "
"you can't handle that next drink, leave. Otherwise you'll wake up somewhere "
"they find hilarious, but you won't be laughing.\n"
"\n"
"Nords also love their skalds. Songs and stories go over well with a drunk "
"audience, once they've had enough of brawling, boasting, and throwing axes "
"at each other. Their songs are all about how they're better than everyone "
"else at everything. They've all heard these over and over again, so bring "
"some of your own. They're desperate to hear something new.\n"
"\n"
"Anywhere you go, drinking is also a good way to redress a mistake or make an "
"apology, and it's the same with Nords. If you lose a contest, you need to "
"buy a drink. If you make a mistake or offend someone, you need to buy a "
"drink. If you're insulted, stand there and take it, then you need to buy a "
"drink.\n"
"\n"
"You don't have to be the best brawler around to survive a room full of "
"drunken Nords. You can also impress them by being clever or by being "
"talented, but you better be really good. When it's time to take a punch in "
"the face, you better be ready for a punch in the face. If you don't like "
"getting punched, there are some things you should never talk about, like "
"politics, who's the best brewmaster, and who punches the hardest. And never "
"demand to know why someone just punched you in the face.\n"

"\n"
"If one has the opportunity—or misfortune—to deal with the wild clansmen of "
"the Reach, you should know who you're dealing with. There are a number of "
"clans who trade calmly and peaceably with the cities of the North. Then, "
"there are those who view travelers as threats. Or as targets. \n"
"\n"
"In my studies, I've identified three clans in particular that should be "
"avoided at all costs.\n"
"\n"
"Boneshaper Clan:\n"
"\n"
"The Boneshapers have developed an unusual number of rituals involving thorny "
"vines and plants. The clan's name stems from their tradition of lacing or "
"growing these vines through the skeletons of their ritual sacrifices. This "
"plant does not appear to be native to the Reach, but they cultivate it well.\n"
"\n"
"When going on a raid or into battle they use these vines to create effigies, "
"shaping the plants into rough mockeries of life. Some of these rituals also "
"make use of the dead, though necromancy appears to be forbidden in the clan. "
"It's unclear how these bodies are used, but travelers who see their crude "
"clan symbol should stay well clear.\n"
"\n"
"Rageclaw Clan:\n"
"\n"
"The Rageclaws have domesticated a breed of stout, battle-ready ursines. "
"These bears are trained from an early age, bound to a specific clansman or "
"clan family. A matriarchal society, this clan imitates their animal "
"companions in many ways. The protection of young clan members is paramount, "
"and I've seen whole Rageclaw families go into battle over the slightest "
"threat to their children.\n"
"\n"
"A particular habit of the clan causes them friction with other Reach clans: "
"Rageclaws are known to overtake and absorb other smaller clans, converting "
"them to the way of the claw. Women new to the clan find they have tremendous "
"control and freedom, and often enjoy the transition. Male warriors are "
"pitted against grown bears in one-on-one combat, earning a place in the clan "
"by forcing an ursine to submit. It usually goes poorly for clansmen "
"unfamiliar with these massive beasts.\n"
"\n"
"Stonetalon Clan: \n"
"\n"
"Finally the Stonetalon clan, while not as outwardly aggressive as the other "
"two clans above, exhibit a number of particular and combative behaviors. As "
"with the Rageclaws, Stonetalon clans are matriarchies. However, women of the "
"tribe seem to be rare. When they're seen, their women seem to be covered in "
"heavy cloaks made of bird feathers, as if they've all taken ill. I believe "
"they're struggling through a series of trials for an unknown purpose. \n"
"\n"
"In any case, every cloaked female I've encountered has been a powerful "
"spellcaster. Stonetalon clans, as a result, may be the most dangerous groups "
"to meet far afield."

"\n"
"They call me mad and have branded me insane. I accept the title they have "
"given me, and wear it proudly as a badge of honor. For the name I now carry "
"shows that I was willing to enter the dark places, over and over again. To "
"brave the ruins of madness and chaos to bring knowledge to the world. The "
"Three protect me from the things I have discovered, and keep my mind clear "
"long enough to share this knowledge with the world!\n"
"\n"
"I found my first Daedric ruin when I was a very young man. It was a hidden "
"shrine from the past, dedicated to the Anticipations of the Tribunal. I was "
"rounding up a number of kwama scribs that had wandered away from the herd. I "
"followed the scribs into a hidden canyon, when I heard the pathetic cry of a "
"lost scrib emerging from a crack in the canyon wall. I squeezed through the "
"narrow gap to find that it opened into a large depression in the rock. But "
"no simple cave had I wandered into. No, this space was full of carved stone "
"that at once filled me with both wonder and deep fear. For the oppressive "
"blocks of set stone were decorated with patterns of webbing and spider "
"motifs, and the statue at the center of the space depicted none other than "
"the Anticipation of Vivec, the Webspinner Mephala.\n"
"\n"
"Words carved into the base of the statue burned into my memory, never to be "
"forgotten: \"\"Lust is love. Lies are truth. Death is life.\"\" They "
"frightened me, but also excited me. The experience set me on a path that led "
"to madness and knowledge, though where one ends and the other begins, I "
"cannot tell.\n"
"\n"
"I returned to my family's kwama mine, escorting the scribs back to the herd. "
"Then I packed a bag, said goodbye to my mother, and started my search for "
"the hidden shrines and dark places where the Daedric ruins wait to be "
"discovered.\n"
"\n"
"Not every ruined shrine waits beneath the ground. Some hide in open places "
"that are far from inhabited lands. These might be overgrown with vegetation "
"or lost within the folds of rolling hills and craggy canyons. I have even "
"visited a shrine that was hidden beneath the sea.\n"
"\n"
"Those shrines located in underground caves and complexes tend to appear more "
"ominous and oppressive than those happened upon in the great outdoors, but "
"that could just be the influence of the ever-present darkness and awareness "
"of the crushing walls of stone. Some of these ancient shrines stand alone in "
"the darkness, but others serve as the focal points of great complexes, many "
"of which are guarded by elaborate traps or vicious monsters—or both.\n"
"\n"
"I have visited more than a dozen of these Daedric ruins, and a few were not "
"as abandoned and unused as the Temple would have you believe. There are "
"still those among us who honor and even worship the Daedric Princes, and I "
"discovered more than a few fresh offerings and sacrifices in these dark "
"places. But the true secret, the knowledge that has earned me my new name? "
"For that, I must ask you to keep an open mind and a firm resolve, because "
"what I am about to reveal may sound unbelievable. It may even sound like the "
"beginning of a campfire story, one intended to frighten before bedtime. But "
"I assure you, this is no story.\n"
"\n"
"What did I find at that first shrine to the Webspinner that I wandered into "
"by luck and accident? What drove me from my parents' home in search of other "
"Daedric ruins? It was the voice. Beautiful and seductive. It whispered to "
"me, told me secrets that I never should have heard. The whispers emanated "
"from the ancient, cracked statue. They echoed from the cavern walls. They "
"reverberated through my mind, building in volume and intensity until they "
"drowned out my own thoughts and memories. They frightened me, these whispers."
" But they also excited me, and I had to hear more. But the Webspinner was "
"done with me. She imparted her words of wisdom and dark secrets and fell "
"silent. The place was once more abandoned, desolate.\n"
"\n"
"If I wanted to hear more—and I so very much wanted to hear more—I would have "
"to find another shrine. And so my life's work was set before me. I had to "
"find other secret places, other hidden ruins. I had to hear what the other "
"Daedra had to say. Not because I worship them. Not because I had fallen "
"under some dark spell. No, I needed to learn more so that I could share it "
"with the world. It was imperative! It was my duty! But, as I write these "
"words, I find that I can't reveal what the whispers told me. My hand won't "
"put the whispers to paper. It refuses no matter how hard I try!\n"
"\n"
"It seems I have failed in my mission. All I can do is tell you that there "
"are secrets to learn. But it appears that if you want to learn them, you'll "
"have to make the trip yourself. Visit the dark ruins, listen to the whispers."
" Perhaps you'll fare better than I, and the whispers won't drive you mad."

"하는 이름은 내가 그 어두운 곳에 몇 번이고 들어갈 의향이 있었음을 보여주기 때문이다. 광기와 혼돈의 폐허를 용감하게 대면하여 이 세상에 "

"길로 만들었고, 언제 어디서 어떻게 끝나게 될지 알 수 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 스크립들을 다시 무리로 호송하며 가족의 크와마 광산으로 돌아왔다. 그리고 나는 가방을 싸서 어머니에게 작별 인사를 하고 데이드릭 "
"폐어로부터 발견되기를 바라는 숨겨진 성소들과 어두운 곳을 찾기 시작했다.\n"
"\n"
"모든 폐허가 된 성소들이 지하에 존재하는 건 아니다. 어떤 성소들은 사람이 사는 땅에서 멀리 떨어진 평야에 위치한다. 이것들은 초목으로 "
"가득하거나 구불구불한 언덕과 험준한 협곡들 사이에서 길을 잃을 수도 있다. 나는 기어코 바다 밑에 숨어 있던 성소까지 찾아갔다.\n"

"지하 동굴과 구조물들에 위치한 성소들은 거대한 야외에 있는 성소들보다 더 불길하고 나를 짓누르는 것처럼 보이지만, 그것은 단지 지속되는 "
"어둠과 무너지는 돌벽 때문일 수 있다. 이러한 고대 성소들 중 일부는 어둠 속에 홀로 서 있지만, 다른 성소들은 정교한 함정이나 악랄한 "
"괴물들, 또는 둘 다에 의해 지켜지는 거대한 복합체들의 초점 역할을 한다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 이 데이드릭 폐허들 중 십여 곳을 찾아갔는데, 몇몇 폐허들은 당신이 다니는 신전만큼 버려지지도 않았고 새 것 같았다. 우리 중에는 "
"아직도 데이드릭 프린스를 기리고 숭배하는 사람들이 있는데, 나도 이 어두운 곳에서 몇 가지 이상의 신선한 제물과 제물을 발견했다. 하지만 "
"진정한 비밀, -그 지식 때문에 내 새로운 이름이 생겼지?- 그러기 위해서는 열린 마음과 굳은 결심을 지켜 달라고 부탁해야겠다. 왜냐하면 "

"나오도록 했을지 아는가? 그 것은 바로 목소리였다. 무척이나 아름답고 유혹적인 목소리였다. 그 목소리는 내게 속삭였고, 절대 들어선 안 "

"\n"
"For as long as I can remember, my life has been devoted to one thing: taking "
"the lives of others. These were not random killings. Only those who fell "
"afoul of the law, who wronged the Houses of Morrowind, or who desecrated the "
"sacred teachings of the Tribunal were fair game.\n"
"\n"
"Their lives were mine to take. Given to me, you might say, because they "
"deserved to die. And I was very good at killing.\n"
"\n"
"My victims were mostly unaware that I was coming for them. Some knew they "
"had wronged others: murdered an innocent, stole from the Houses, even bedded "
"another's lover. But they would always claim they had done nothing wrong. "
"That I was mistaken. That I had the wrong man or woman. With a blade at a "
"throat, however, it's amazing how honestly and completely one makes a "
"confession.\n"
"\n"
"One after another, I ended them. A swift slice across the throat. The "
"shallow flesh parted, the thin veins severed cleanly. They would try to "
"scream, but they would only choke on the crimson gore that filled their "
"lungs.\n"
"\n"
"I delighted in death. It filled me with a pleasure I could find in no other "
"activity. This was my life. This was who I was.\n"
"\n"
"People feared me. Loved me. And my brothers and sisters. Pushed us away, and "
"then embraced us as the need arose.\n"
"\n"
"Some days we were hailed as heroes. Others, as murderers. Those in power "
"fell to our secret blades. And then those who gave us the orders followed.\n"
"\n"
"But there was a mistake. A flaw in our process. We had grown too perfect. We "
"had extracted justice from innocent blood.\n"
"\n"
"Such is the way, even with the most clear-cut contract. There is always a "
"chance that the law is wrong. That it made a mistake. The contract never "
"lies, but it isn't always correct, either. Even the smallest of actions, "
"harmless as they may seem, can cause a tidal wave of destruction for those "
"following behind.\n"
"\n"
"A fool's pride veils his judgment. In a moment of passion, blood scrawled "
"upon the wall says it all. \"\"Morag Tong.\"\" Those words scream out, loud "
"and insistent. They echo throughout the world, labeling us as ruthless "
"killers that follow no rules, that have no laws.\n"
"\n"
"The Tong, always hidden, working in secret, suddenly fell under scrutiny. "
"They wanted to drag us out of the shadows and into the light. We withdrew, "
"deeper into the shadows. Our contracts became fewer, our jobs turned into "
"small tasks. We ran errands for bored House nobles. We endured.\n"
"\n"
"And we obeyed. We remained loyal. We swore on our lives to uphold the cause, "
"and we would not turn our backs on it now, no matter the level of difficulty "
"facing us. Even if the world had turned its backs on us, we would stay the "
"course.\n"
"\n"
"Our leaders whisper to us. They tell us to practice patience. They assure us "
"that the day shall come when our hand of justice once again reaches out to "
"grasp the world. A coming darkness will soon sweep the land.\n"
"\n"
"And the Morag Tong will once more be needed. Will once again become relevant."
"\n"
"\n"
"But I am old and my days wind down. I prepare for my trip to Vounoura, and I "
"must pass this mantle to someone younger now. Someone less experienced, less "
"wise. My son and my daughter will soon take up the dagger, but they have not "
"seen our greatness. They must forge a new path for the Morag Tong.\n"
"\n"
"The darkness of war comes, and no one shall be spared from its wrath.\n"
"\n"
"The Morag Tong must put aside the wrongs it has endured. We must be ready."

"By Drelisa Hlaalu, House Historian\n"
"\n"
"War among the Great Houses of Morrowind isn't unique, and more often than "
"not some kind of conflict between two or more Houses is under way somewhere "
"across the land. Rarely do these conflicts escalate from subterfuge and "
"intrigue to all-out war, but open hostilities aren't unheard of in the "
"history of Morrowind. Let me tell you about one of these wars.\n"
"\n"
"In 2E 559, House Hlaalu and House Dres advanced beyond the usual tensions "
"and posturing and fielded squads of combatants south of Narsis, on the "
"border of the Black Marsh. It wasn't the first time these two economic "
"rivals had challenged each other, and it wouldn't be the last, but the "
"actual war was memorable, both in scope and in the number of casualties that "
"piled up over the course of the battles.\n"
"\n"
"House Hlaalu was determined to set up a trading post in the disputed "
"territory. House Dres was just as determined not to let that happen. Halfway "
"through the construction of the outpost, the House Hlaalu workers suddenly "
"found themselves surrounded by Dres mercenaries. The small squad of Hlaalu "
"guards assigned to protect the workers, led by Purilla Falen, quickly "
"established defenses and prepared to defend the outpost. The Dres "
"mercenaries, who outnumbered the Hlaalu guards five-to-one, assumed they "
"would make short work of the defenders and have the post burned to the "
"ground before the midday meal.\n"
"\n"
"But that's not the way it happened.\n"
"\n"
"Purilla and her guards repelled the first assault with relative ease. She "
"was determined to hold the line, no matter the cost, until reinforcements "
"arrived. To facilitate the appearance of aid, Purilla set the one wizard "
"they brought with them to work on opening a portal to Narsis. If the guards "
"could hold back the onslaught of the Dres mercenaries long enough, an open "
"portal could provide a path for Hlaalu battle-merchants to pour out of to "
"turn the tide of battle. They only needed a little time.\n"
"\n"
"As the wizard performed the portal ritual, Purilla and the defenders met "
"each House Dres attack with skill and ferocity. The mercenaries rushed in, "
"sending a wave of attackers at the post's barricades. Each wave was turned "
"away, but not without a cost. After five hours and four separate waves of "
"attacks, Purilla's forces were reduced to a third of their original size. By "

"And the wizard required a few more minutes to complete the ritual and open "

"The seven defenders, magnificent in their fury, fought with honor and savage "

"fell. Two. Four. Now only Purilla and two Hlaalu guards remained at the "
"battlements. The Hlaalu workers, who had been providing support and watchful "
"eyes throughout the previous battles, took to the walls as well, using tools "
"and the weapons of the fallen guards to help defend the post. For all their "
"effort, it appeared that the crushing weight of the Dres assault was about "
"to engulf them.\n"
"\n"
"And then the portal opened.\n"
"\n"
"House Hlaalu battle-merchants streamed through the portal, hurling spells "
"and arrows into the ranks of the surprised mercenaries. A full cohort "
"emerged from the portal and crashed against the wall of Dres mercenaries. "
"The wall held for a few long moments, and then it shattered against the "
"weight of the Hlaalu troops. Dres mercenaries fell in scores before their "
"line finally broke and the remaining mercenaries turned to flee. The battle-"
"merchants chased after them just long enough to make sure they were really "
"routed, and then they formed up to secure the post.\n"
"\n"
"Brave and noble Purilla Falen was responsible for the Hlaalu victory that "
"day, but she didn't survive the final battle. A Dres mercenary's blade had "
"caught her in the neck as they were retreating. She was dead before a healer "
"could reach her side. Thanks to histories like these, however, her efforts "
"will never be forgotten."

"Observations on the Mabrigash\n"
"from the journals of Bonorion the Wanderer, 2E 568\n"
"\n"
"In Deshaan, I encountered a strange tribe of Dark Elf Ashlanders. They call "
"themselves Mabrigash. Unlike their Vvardenfell brethren, this tribe is not "
"nomadic and appears to have settled in an isolated region of Deshaan, a "
"location they call the Vale of the Ghost Snake. I believe they have "
"concocted the story of the perilous Ghost Snake to discourage outsiders from "
"lingering too long in their village. Although, frankly, their rudeness, "
"which rivals that of any of the more civilized Dark Elves I have ever met, "
"is more than enough to drive outsiders away. However, my curiosity about "
"this isolated tribe steeled me against their attitude. I remained nearby for "
"a time, watching them and recording my observations. Forthwith, here are my "
"findings on the Mabrigash:\n"
"\n"
"The Mabrigash do not welcome visitors.\n"
"\n"
"The Mabrigash appears to be a matriarchal society, and their females are "
"definitely more dominant than males. They also seem to outnumber the males "
"by a factor of three or four to one. I wouldn't say this society hates "
"males, but they certainly don't trust them or like them very much. At least "
"as far as I can tell.\n"
"\n"
"They claim a Ghost Snake gives them advice and watches over the Vale. I "
"believe they use this so-called \"\"Ghost Snake\"\" to scare visitors away "
"and to keep the village population in line.\n"
"\n"
"It appears they sacrifice their own tribe members to this mythical deity. "
"The tribal elders encourage trials to honor this \"\"Ghost Snake,\"\" and "
"many of these end in the death of the participants.\n"
"\n"
"Here is the legend of the Ghost Snake, as it was told to me by a charming "
"little lady of some six or seven years of age. She approached me with "
"absolutely no fear or hesitation. She asked me why I was being so creepy and "
"watching them all the time. At least, that was the gist of it. My "
"understanding of the Mabrigash dialect is rudimentary, at best. I deflected "
"her question with one of my own. \"\"What is this Ghost Snake I keep hearing "
"about?\"\" I asked her.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Follow the Coiled Path and you'll find out,\"\" she replied with a bat "
"of her cute little eyelashes. \"\"The Ghost Snake offers advice and "
"protection, as long as we care for the Vale,\"\" she continued. "
"\"\"Everybody knows that.\"\" She went on to tell me that the Ghost Snake "
"was the combined spiritual essence of the tribe's female ancestors, given "
"spectral form by the belief and respect of the living tribe members. Or that "
"it was a creepy dead snake that liked to haunt the Vale and eat innocent "
"Mabrigash children. She spoke very fast, and as I've said before, my mastery "
"of the dialect was far from perfect.\n"
"\n"
"From an economic perspective, the tribe crafts unique snakeskin leather. "
"They use this leather for everything, from clothing to packs to a simple "
"armor. They are, however, unwilling to sell or trade this wonderful material "
"to outsiders—or even to the men of their own tribe. Everyone involved could "
"make a fortune if the Mabrigash could be convinced to open trade with the "
"outside world.\n"
"\n"
"I met a Mabrigash scout on patrol. She threatened to \"\"toss me to the "
"ghosts and serpents on the Coiled Path.\"\" Fortunately, my speed and tree-"
"climbing skills far exceeded hers, so I was able to avoid this savage "
"ceremonial rite. Additional observation leads me to the conclusion that the "
"tribe subsists on a diet primarily consisting of snake meat. This may "
"contribute to their uncontrollably hostile demeanor.\n"
"\n"
"After several days camping nearby and continuing my observations, a rather "
"fearsome Mabrigash warrior visited me. He said he was the Gulakhan. He said "
"the only reason they had not simply tossed me to the serpents within the "
"Vale was that the Farseer labeled me a hapless idiot. I am sure I missed "
"something in the translation of the message. When I asked to meet with the "
"Farseer, this Gulakhan's hand seemed to tighten on the hilt of the rather "
"nasty-looking sword that hung at his side. It was then I decided that my "
"time among the Mabrigash Tribe had come to an end.\n"
"\n"
"***\n"
"\n"
"Annotation from Nuros Raloro, Tribunal Scholar Priest, Mournhold 2E 576\n"
"\n"
"This utterly ludicrous \"\"observation\"\" was found abandoned near the "
"border to Stonefalls some years ago. The Bosmer chronicler Bonorion does not "
"appear to have the wit of a five-year-old child when it comes to accurately "
"recording unusual events or peoples. He resorts to making things up or "
"taking wild leaps of illogic to come to his so-called \"\"conclusions.\"\" "
"This document has been preserved within the Tribunal library and copies have "
"been distributed, as he did at least conduct some conversations with the "
"Mabrigash, and information on this tribe remains scarce."

"By Kireth Vanos, Dungeon-Delver Extraordinaire\n"
"\n"
"We know almost nothing about them, except that they left behind the most "
"interesting and exciting ruins. You know who I'm talking about. That's "
"right! The Dwarves—or the Dwemer, for the scholars among you who might be "
"reading this. (My brother Raynor insists I call them Dwemer, but I like the "
"name Dwarves better. It rolls off the tongue, in my opinion.)\n"
"\n"
"Now, dungeon-delving is serious work (no matter how much fun it might be), "
"and can be pretty dangerous besides. Just finding a Dwarven ruin is no small "
"accomplishment, but getting into one and back out again in one piece can be "
"next to impossible. But before I get to that, let's talk about the ruins "
"themselves.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves created a vast network of underground complexes and cities. Why they "
"preferred to build beneath rock and soil, I couldn't say, but that's where "
"they built them. So that's where you'll have to go if you want to visit a "
"Dwarven ruin. Once you do find one, you'll know it. Dwarven architecture has "
"a distinctive look and feel, from the surface entryways to the subterranean "
"structures. They utilized natural openings in the rock wherever possible, "
"tending to decorate and carve existing rock and natural pillars. They only "
"built new structures when it was absolutely necessary, usually to support "
"other structures or to install fortifications.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to carving and shaping the natural rock, Dwarves used stone as "
"their primary building material. Some metal appears within their ruins, "
"primarily brass, used as accents and in mechanical construction. And here's "
"the really exciting part: Dwarves loved their gadgets, and their ruins are "
"full of them! I don't mean just traps, though some of the most devious were "
"designed and built by the long-gone Dwarves. I mean heating and cooling "
"systems made up of steam pistons and great gears, glowing lights that shine "
"from the walls, giant wheels that turn as water cascades over them, "
"multifaceted gems that fire beams of light, and many other wonders too "
"numerous to mention.\n"
"\n"
"It's eerie to walk through a Dwarven ruin. It's supposed to be empty, "
"deserted, but the lights continue to glow and the pipes continue to steam. "
"It's like the place is waiting for someone to return, as though the Dwarves "
"just stepped out for a moment and haven't been gone for hundreds of years.\n"
"\n"
"Then there are the inhabitants of the ruins, for a Dwarven complex isn't as "
"devoid of life as you might think. In fact, some of the ruins virtually teem "
"with the stuff. But it isn't life as you or I know it. It's mechanical life. "
"Constructs. They wander the chambers and corridors of these dungeons, "
"performing tasks assigned to them in ages past. But make no mistake, if a "
"construct spots you, it will attack you. With whirring blades and piston-"
"powered swords, the Dwarven constructs pose a significant threat to any "
"would-be dungeon-delver. Worse, the constructs know how to repair each "
"other, so the ruins seem to contain an endless supply of the mechanical "
"creatures.\n"
"\n"
"So, to successfully enter and exit a Dwarven ruin, you need to spot and "
"disarm (or otherwise bypass) devious traps, avoid or defeat an army of "
"increasingly more powerful wandering constructs, and figure out how to open "
"strange locks that might or might not require something that looks like a "
"key. It can be a bit maddening, but personally I find the challenge to be "
"remarkably fun. \n"
"\n"
"Of course, everything I've written thus far has been theory and conjecture. "
"My brother and I have yet to enter a Dwarven ruin, and all of our practice "
"has been within the mundane dungeons that dot the land. But I've read all "
"the books! We've finally acquired the funding we need to tackle the Dwarven "
"ruin known as Bthanual, and I plan to write about that adventure in the very "
"near future.\n"
"\n"
"In the meantime, let's all be careful out there. Remember that a dungeon "
"isn't all fun and games. Survival is serious business, and we're in this "
"line of work to not only thrive—but to survive!"

"함정 만을 의미하는 것이 아니라 가장 기괴한 것들 중 몇 몇도 오래전 사라진 드워프들에 의해 설계되고 건설되었다. 내 말은 증기 피스톤과 "
"훌륭한 기어로 구성된 난방과 냉방 시스템, 벽에서 빛나는 영롱한 불빛, 돌아가며 물을 폭포처럼 흘리는 거대한 바퀴, 광선을 발사하는 "

"Welcome to Shad Astula, the Academy of Magic! This is where the most "
"talented mages of the Ebonheart Pact come to learn, share a common origin, "
"and become leaders in the magical community. Your journey begins here.  \n"
"\n"
"For many, the journey to master magic is fraught with frustration and "
"difficulty. The training provided here can lead to a life of service and "
"rewarding work, thanks to the availability of the best teachers and teaching "
"methods. The fact of the matter is, while everyone invited to the Academy is "
"selected for their potential for greatness, not all of you will measure up "
"to the task before you. For those unfortunate enough to fail, Shad Astula "
"serves as a safety net, a place to refine one's meager skills without "
"causing harm to oneself or to others.\n"
"\n"
"But you will not fail. You are not one of the unfortunates. You will rise "
"above. You will take your place as a leader in the Ebonheart Pact!\n"
"\n"
"You have already realized that you are different from others who can wield "
"the gift of magicka. Now, prepare to be introduced to a world of power. For "
"you, Shad Astula serves as a place where you can spread your wings. With the "
"help of our staff of master mages, you will not only learn to fly, you will "
"soar!\n"
"\n"
"As one of the chosen of the Academy, the usual restrictions and rules that "
"govern the learning of magic do not apply to you. Those rules exist to "
"ensure the safety of mages who may pose a danger to themselves or to others. "
"We anticipate that the Academy's select students will excel, and we believe "
"you're capable of learning your limits quickly. A few guidelines do apply, "
"however:\n"
"\n"
"     —Do not summon creatures from Oblivion planes, except within designated "
"summoning circles.\n"
"     —Magical experimentation on other Academy students is forbidden.\n"
"     —Magical experimentation on non-Academy members is discouraged, but use "
"your best judgment.\n"
"     —Magical experimentation on staff is encouraged. Keep them on their "
"guard, and they'll do the same for you.\n"
"     —Designation of assistants as \"\"minions\"\" is strictly prohibited, "
"and cultist or cabalist behaviors or organizations will be dealt with "
"swiftly and harshly. Save your megalomania for after graduation.\n"
"     —Students who have not passed the Emotional Control and Mental "
"Stability Exam (ECMSE) are forbidden from sharing a room.\n"
"     —Magical dueling is strictly prohibited, except under a staff "
"Battlemage's supervision.\n"
"\n"
"You will soon receive an appointment with the Headmaster, who will have more "
"to say about Shad Astula and your status as a member of the Academy. In the "
"meantime, feel free to explore the campus and introduce yourself to your "
"fellow students. Some will become your peers, others your underlings, and a "
"very select few your betters. Learn them well.\n"
"\n"
"Welcome to Shad Astula. Spread your wings and soar! We expect much of you. "
"Do not disappoint us."

"Developing and maintaining a kwama mine can be a rewarding, and more "
"importantly, a lucrative pursuit, provided one takes the time to learn about "
"kwama and their environmental requirements. Kwama are giant insects that "
"live and work in underground colonies called egg mines. Although eggs "
"provide the primary source of income for any kwama mine, they are by no "
"means the only product produced by the mine. Kwama cuttle, scrib jelly, and "
"scrib jerky all provide additional sources of revenue for a kwama mine.\n"
"\n"
"To start a kwama mine:\n"
"\n"
"1a. Find and tame a wild kwama colony (difficult), or\n"
"1b. Purchase excess kwama from a crowded mine (expensive)\n"
"2. Live near the colony until you smell like kwama\n"
"3. Never approach the kwama queen chamber\n"
"4. Gather eggs, collect cuttle\n"
"5. Count your profit\n"
"\n"
"Despite the name, a kwama mine consists of living creatures. With judicious "
"yet unobtrusive maintenance, a moderately-sized mine can produce an "
"abundance of valuable kwama eggs. Kwama mines can also produce tasty scrib "
"jerky, acidic scrib jelly, and kwama cuttle, which is highly valued by "
"alchemists.\n"
"\n"
"The Kwama Colony: The road to owning a profitable mining concern starts with "
"a healthy kwama queen and a full complement of workers. The queen produces "
"eggs in the deepest recesses of the mine. Kwama workers care for the eggs, "
"moving them to the various tunnels and chambers within the mine, according "
"to space requirements, environmental conditions, and the development state "
"of the eggs. Kwama workers also produce food for the mine, feed and clean "
"the queen, and expand the mine complex as the colony grows. When not tending "
"to their usual duties, workers can be seen digging new chambers and tunnels "
"within the ever-growing labyrinth of the mine. Workers tend to be docile, "
"but can turn violent if threatened or attacked, or if the queen is in danger."
"\n"
"\n"
"Kwama warriors protect the colony, reacting quickly to any perceived danger. "
"They should be treated warily and with respect, for they are aggressive and "
"highly dangerous. While workers are quadrupeds, warriors are bipedal and "
"very powerful.\n"
"\n"
"Scribs, as the miners call juvenile kwama, roam freely through a kwama "
"colony. A mine usually splits the scrib herds into two camps: those allowed "
"to grow into workers or warriors, and those harvested while still young for "
"jelly and jerky. Scrib jelly has a variety of uses, including as a food "
"source, but it is prized by alchemists as a key ingredient to create potions "
"and cure diseases. Scrib jerky, made by drying thin slices of scrib meat, "
"has minor restorative properties and is considered to be quite delicious by "
"Dark Elf culinary experts.\n"
"\n"
"Starting a Kwama Mine: Assuming you don't want to pay the exorbitant fees "
"associated with purchasing a queen and kwama from an established mine, you "
"will need to locate and tame a wild colony. This approach isn't without "
"cost, however, as House Hlaalu requires would-be mine owners to purchase a "
"license before hunting for a wild colony in earnest.\n"
"\n"
"When you locate a potential colony, you can't simply walk in and set up shop."
" The colony's aggressive warriors would make short work of your miners. "
"There is a solution: acclimation. The acclimation process takes time, but "
"injury and loss of life (of both colony members and miners) can be minimized "
"by letting the colony slowly become familiar and comfortable with your "
"presence. Once your miners acquire the smell of the local kwama, the "
"warriors will consider them to be part of the colony.  \n"
"\n"
"Egg Harvesting: The actual \"\"mining\"\" of kwama eggs doesn't require a "
"great deal of skill. Miners basically need only patience and common sense to "
"perform their job. Egg harvesting must be done with an eye toward balance. "
"Remove too many eggs and you may agitate the workers and the queen. Remove "
"too few and the queen's egg production may fall. The mine manager must keep "
"a careful eye on production to ensure that the queen does not produce too "
"many or too few eggs. Wide swings in production will affect profits and make "
"planning more difficult, and should be avoided.\n"
"\n"
"Avoid the queen's chamber at all times. Warriors and workers will view any "
"approach to their queen as a threat and react accordingly. Production can "
"grind to a halt as the colony becomes agitated and miners can't safely enter "
"the mine. You might lose a few miners as the colony rampages, but the most "
"important thing to remember is that the kwama will eventually calm down and "
"once again accept the presence of the miners.\n"
"\n"
"Note: House Hlaalu egg-mining licenses require mines to provide regular "
"production reports. Failure to comply can result in sanctions, fines, or "
"even closure of the mine. And that's neither fun nor profitable."

"A number of powerful healing relics are associated with Saint Veloth the "
"Pilgrim. Of these, perhaps the most famous and well-remembered artifact "
"remains the Judgment of Saint Veloth. This mighty Daedric warhammer stands "
"as a shining symbol of everything Veloth embodies as the patron saint of "
"outcasts and seekers of spiritual knowledge.\n"
"\n"
"Stored with other holy artifacts in the protected vaults of the Tribunal "
"Temple, the Judgment of Saint Veloth served the prophet and mystic well in "
"life, but has gained legendary powers since his ascension to sainthood. The "
"God-Kings of Morrowind watch over the relics, keeping them ready for the day "
"when their powers would be needed in defense of the realm.\n"
"\n"
"Saint Veloth personifies daring, and those who follow the lessons of his "
"life and teachings learn boldness and cultivate an adventurous outlook. He "
"defined the difference between good and evil Daedra, and even negotiated the "
"original arrangements with the good Daedric Princes. This ability to "
"distinguish the good from the bad was a hallmark of the living saint, as was "
"his penchant for healing and healing items. Both of these aspects combined "
"into his personal symbol of power, the warhammer known as Judgment.\n"
"\n"
"Veloth's Judgment rang with authority throughout the land, using its "
"enchantments to cleanse corruption from the souls of those it struck down. "
"It was a weapon, of that there can be no doubt. But Veloth was able to wield "
"it with the same precision that a surgeon uses to wield a scalpel, removing "
"the corruption from a soul and leaving the remainder alive and healthy. The "
"warhammer stored the corruption for a time, turning it into energy that "
"could be used by the wielder to enhance the power of the weapon.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, in the wrong hands such a powerful artifact could accomplish more "
"harm than good. For this reason, among many others, the Tribunal keeps the "
"Judgment and other artifacts locked away. It has been suggested that instead "
"of being used as an instrument of healing, the Judgment could be used to "
"siphon a living creature's entire soul, thus making the wielder infinitely "
"more powerful. This conjecture has never been put into practice, and if the "
"Tribunal has its way, it never will."

"Dear Thane Vigli Storm-Breast,\n"
"\n"
"Honored leader of the Nord Cultural Exchange, it is I, Rigurt the Brash, "
"writing to you in Windhelm as you requested. I have arrived in the hot and "
"sandy land of Northern Elsweyr, home of the Khajiit cat people. It is very "
"hot. And sandy. And you wouldn't believe how many Khajiit live here! It is "
"more than Rigurt can count on both hands and even his feet!\n"
"\n"
"Rigurt wants you to know that he is hip-deep in making friendly overtures to "
"the nice cat people. Soon we will have a signed peace treaty and a fully "
"operational cultural exchange. Has Rigurt ever failed you before. Well, "
"except for that one time. And that other one. But I digest. And speaking of "
"digesting, let me tell you about all the amazing food Rigurt has consumed "
"here in the land of Anequina! (That's what the cat people call Northern "
"Elsweyr.) \n"
"\n"
"First, let me tell you about the cat food. Much of it is sweet, but it is "
"also quite delicious. Goes well with mead, too. Three particular dishes "
"stood out for Rigurt. I even acquired the recipes, so I can cook them for "
"you when I return to Windhelm. We will have a feast fit for the Skald King! "
"Do you think he would like to join us?\n"
"\n"
"I came upon a stall in a back alley in Rimmen where a twitchy little doggy-"
"cat (don't ask me, the different types of Khajiit confuse Rigurt, too) was "
"stirring a large pot from which wafted a most-pleasing aroma. It reminded me "
"of the Thane Jeggi's Drinking Hole—a combination of the pungent smell of "
"fish and the sweet smell of spilled mead. Turns out, the doggy-cat was "
"cooking what he referred to as sweet-glazed fish bits. I didn't know that "
"fishes had bits, but when tossed with moon-sugar and stir-fried to a crispy "
"crunch, they make for a nice afternoon snack. Rigurt ate four servings!\n"
"\n"
"In the town of Riverhold, Rigurt entered the Inn of Banished Regrets as I "
"have many, many regrets that need banishing. Immediately, Rigurt noticed "
"that all the cat people were not only drinking—they were eating crunchy "
"little nuggets by the handful! Rigurt's mouth gushes with saliva just "
"writing down these words! Who knew you could turn smelly, scaly lizards into "
"delicious crunchy lizard kibble? It cost me a week's worth of mead, but I "
"was able to convince the inn's cook to give me a copy of the recipe. It "
"seems that the cat people can't stop eating the stuff, and Rigurt feels the "
"same way. I just wish I hadn't read the recipe. Turns out, they use the "
"inside of the lizard to make kibble, not the outside!\n"
"\n"
"One dish that tasted amazing was the meat-cake pie I had at a cart in the "
"Stitches. My taste buds did loops as they savory-sweet succulent slid down "
"from my mouth to my tummy. Was it the main meal or dessert? It seemed to "
"Rigurt to be both at the same time! It was confusing but very tasty. The "
"chef refused to enlighten Rigurt as to what kind of actual meat was used as "
"the filling. All she would say was, \"\"a little of this and a little of "
"that.\"\" I will have to experiment when I get back to my own kitchen. Do "
"not worry, I will make enough to share!\n"
"\n"
"Now, by this point in my trip, Rigurt has just about had his fill of sweet, "
"sweet Khajiiti cooking. I was desperate to find a spicy rabbit meatball or a "
"haunch of stewed mutton, but such Nord delicacies don't seem to exist in "
"Northern Elsweyr. But I did find a bottle of Dark Moons spiced whiskey. "
"While mead is the nectar of the gods, this spiced whiskey that the cat "
"people distill burns so good on the way down. Rigurt got the impression that "
"it was the beverage of choice for when even the Khajiiti sweet-tooth needs a "
"break from all the syrupy goodness they consume on a regular basis. I "
"acquired three casks of the stuff and plan to put it on the next boat to "
"Skyrim as a gift for the Skald King. I know how much Jorunn appreciates a "
"strong drink when he listens to my latest cultural report.\n"

"To: Lord Gharesh-ri, Speaker of the Mane\n"
"From: Khamira, Agent of the Speaker\n"
"\n"
"We know that the Usurper Queen employs necromancers and dark sorcery, and "
"has done so from the beginning of her reign. In recent months, however, the "
"number of necromancers supporting her forces have increased dramatically. It "
"all comes back to one source—the dark mage and Euraxia's chief necromancer, "
"Zumog Phoom.\n"
"\n"
"Zumog Phoom, the self-proclaimed \"\"lord of the dark arts,\"\" reportedly "
"hails from the northernmost climes of Wrothgar. Maddeningly few facts "
"concerning this Orc necromancer can be gleaned from his early life, though "
"suppositions are plentiful. We know that the wilds of Wrothgar are "
"unforgiving, and life among the Orc strongholds is often harsh, bleak, and "
"brutal. Still, we know that those Orcs who not only survive but flourish "
"resemble a well-made sword that has been forged, beaten, and sharpened to a "
"razor's edge.\n"
"\n"
"The first real evidence of his existence prior to Anequina appears in "
"intelligence reports investigating the activities of the Worm Cult during "
"the Planemeld crisis. While details remain slim, Zumog Phoom's name appears "
"as a ranking member of the cult and hints at a close connection to "
"Mannimarco, leader of the Order of the Black Worm. However, we know that he "
"was active here in Rimmen shortly after the Frostfall Coup, so he probably "
"did not have a direct hand in the cult's activities during the Planemeld.\n"
"\n"
"Euraxia either specifically recruited Zumog Phoom or was approached by the "
"Orc after she claimed the throne of Rimmen. He had a small group of "
"followers at first, lesser necromancers that formed the basis of his "
"personal dark cult. The Northern Elsweyr Defense Force occasionally faced a "
"lone zombie or a small group of skeletons, but for the most part, the "
"necromancers have served little more than a supporting role in Euraxia's "
"army. I fear that may be about to change.\n"
"\n"
"Since the end of the Planemeld and the apparent disbanding of the Worm Cult, "
"a great number of necromancers have flocked to the Usurper Queen's banner to "
"learn from the cruel yet charismatic Zumog Phoom. The few sorcerers that we "
"have captured demonstrate an almost manic reverence for their Orc leader, "
"regaling us with tales of his dark powers and threats of what he and Euraxia "
"will do once Elsweyr is totally under their control. They revealed few "
"actionable details while still providing hints about what Zumog Phoom is "
"doing in his hidden lairs and \"\"undead forges\"\"—their term, not mine.\n"
"\n"
"If the rumors are to be believed, Zumog Phoom and his acolytes have "
"established manufactories away from prying eyes where they can perform "
"rituals, conduct experiments, and raise an army of undead soldiers to "
"bolster Euraxia's mercenary forces. We have yet to see the products of these "
"vile places, but we have discovered evidence of grave robbing throughout the "
"region, especially around Ashen Scar and other mass graves from the worst "
"period of the Knahaten flu outbreak.\n"
"\n"
"Speaker, we must find a means for dealing with Zumog Phoom and his followers "
"before they provide Euraxia with an unlimited supply of soldiers. The "
"Defense Force cannot repel an army that does not tire and can be ceaselessly "
"replenished. Our best chance is to locate the undead forges and destroy them "
"before they can be turned up to full capacity.\n"
"\n"
"And if we can kill Zumog Phoom, so much the better."

"Implications for Elsweyr and the Aldmeri Dominion\n"
"\n"
"By Tandemen, Sapiarch of Foreign Observations\n"
"\n"
"It was in the year 2E 576, four years before the return of Ayrenn and the "
"formation of the Aldmeri Dominion, that Euraxia Tharn murdered the Royal "
"Family of Anequina and illegally claimed the throne of Rimmen. How did this "
"occur and what should the Dominion do about it? Allow me to provide a few "
"pertinent observations.\n"
"\n"
"Earlier that same year, Emperor Leovic legalized the worship of Daedra "
"throughout the Empire of Cyrodiil, which immediately sparked a rebellion. As "
"Varen Aquilarios began his own push to take control of the Empire, Euraxia "
"Tharn was sent on a diplomatic mission to Northern Elsweyr. Taking advantage "
"of the confusion, she hired a massive force of Nibenese mercenaries and "
"marched into Rimmen as a welcomed ally. As part of the Empire, King Hemakar "
"of Rimmen did not think twice about accepting an envoy of the Emperor. That "
"turned out to be a deadly mistake.\n"
"\n"
"Euraxia had King Hemakar and the rest of the Royal Family executed and "
"declared herself Queen of Rimmen. Her mercenaries, now wearing the livery of "
"Euraxians, spread out and quickly conquered all of Northern Elsweyr, "
"claiming the territory from Riverhold to Rimmen. Once in power, Euraxia "
"worked quickly to consolidate her position. She hired additional "
"mercenaries, acquired the services of a cult of necromancers, and "
"established a perimeter of siege weapons to maintain her hold over Rimmen. "
"The Khajiiti people have not fared well under Euraxian rule. In every "
"meaning of the word, her reign has been nothing short of tyrannical.\n"
"\n"
"Once the dust settled and what was happening became clear, the Khajiit "
"formed a militia to combat the Euraxians and attempt to reclaim Anequina. "
"When Queen Ayrenn established the alliance and formed the Dominion, she "
"promised the Khajiiti people that they would have her support in regaining "
"control of Northern Elsweyr. However, before any forces could be mustered in "
"that regard, the Three Banners War broke out. Except for a handful of "
"military advisors and some much-needed gold, the Khajiiti Defense Force has "
"been primarily on its own. Lord Gharesh-ri, Speaker of the Mane, traveled to "
"Anequina to take command of the militia, and under his guidance they are "
"close to liberating the town of Riverhold and most of the territory beyond "
"the walls of Rimmen.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, Rimmen remains a bastion for Euraxia, primarily due to the "
"siege weapons that ring the palace and are aimed directly into the city "
"below. Her threat, which Gharesh-ri has no reason to doubt, is that she will "
"destroy the city if her rule there is challenged in any way. Until those "
"siege weapons are dealt with, I expect Euraxia will maintain hold of the "
"Rimmen throne.\n"
"\n"
"While the Three Banners War rages on, Dominion forces cannot be diverted to "
"deal with the tyrant the Khajiit call the Usurper Queen. We must hope that "
"by providing funds and advisors, the Khajiiti militia can hold out until the "
"alliance conflict comes to an end. Otherwise, the Dominion may wind up "
"facing a threat from within its own borders once the war against the "
"Ebonheart Pact and the Daggerfall Covenant ends."

"What a fascinating place, the Orcrest sewers. You can find a staggering "
"amount of wildlife in these putrid depths! As an explorer and amateur "
"naturalist, I find that extremely convenient for my work.\n"
"\n"
"I confess, I came to Orcrest in search of its sewer system with a specific "
"goal in mind. I had heard rumors of a specimen of amorphous green slime "
"transported from distant Murkmire for the express goal of alchemical study "
"in an Orcrest laboratory. It is said that the creature escaped captivity "

"Ne Quin-al Rass-Le, called Anequina Sharp-Tongue in the common language of "
"Cyrodiil, wandered the land for many Moons as Khunzar-ri's boon companion. "
"Some called them lovers, which they were at times. Others called them "
"heroes, for they certainly accomplished heroic deeds. One such deed involved "
"the Maormer. During their travels together, Khunzar-ri and Anequina visited "
"the island of Khenarthi's Roost. The Sea Elves and the Cat-folk co-existed "
"on the island, sometimes on friendly terms, sometimes not. This particular "
"event occurred during one of the latter periods.\n"
"\n"
"There are several versions of this tale. Some focus on how Khunzar-ri saved "
"the day, but the one I like best paints a picture of a different hero. Here "
"is that version of the story.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"One of the Sea Elf captains, a brute by the name of Linvalor, kidnapped the "
"daughter of a Moon-Priest and refused all efforts of negotiation for her "
"release. Anequina said she had an idea, but Khunzar-ri rushed off to save "
"the Moon-Priest's daughter before she could stop him. As crafty and powerful "
"as Khunzar-ri was, he could also be reckless. This recklessness allowed "
"Linvalor and his crew of Maormer cutthroats to capture the would-be hero "
"without too much fuss or bother.\n"
"\n"
"Now it fell to Anequina to rescue both the Moon-Priest's daughter and "
"Khunzar-ri. \"\"How can you succeed when even the great Khunzar-ri "
"failed?\"\" asked the Moon-Priest. \"\"Hrrm,\"\" Anequina purred, \"\"This "
"one will simply do what she does best. The Sea Elf doesn't stand a chance."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"So Anequina walked bravely into Linvalor's camp, ignoring the many sword-"
"wielding pirates to stride directly to where the Sea Elf captain was "
"gambling with his officers. They were involved in a close game of Deceiver's "
"Disks, also called Swords and Shields, and didn't even notice her until she "
"was right on top of them and said, \"\"Hrrm, that looks like an interesting "
"game. Can anyone play or do you only accept gold from wet-earred Elves?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Intrigued and attracted to Anequina's poise and confidence, Linvalor offered "
"her a seat and dismissed the rest of his crew. \"\"We will play,\"\" "
"Linvalor said, \"\"but not for gold. If I win, then you will sail with me "
"for thirty days and thirty nights as my slave and companion.\"\" Anequina "
"feigned shock at such a proclamation. \"\"And if this one wins?\"\" she "
"asked slyly. Linvalor laughed. \"\"No cat, especially no female cat, has "
"ever bested me in anything! So, name your price, cat, and let us play!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Very well,\"\" Anequina said. \"\"If this one wins, then all three of "
"us—the Moon-Priest's daughter, Khunzar-ri, and me—walk away, free and clear."
"\"\" Captain Linvalor, confident that his victory was assured and eager to "
"get the beguiling cat-woman into his bed, agreed.\n"
"\n"
"The match that followed was intense, with Linvalor bluffing and bellowing "
"his way through every round of play while Anequina pretended ignorance of "
"the rules and fear of every rattle of the disk tumbler. Both were expert "
"players, however, and after many rounds and the consumption of an inordinate "
"amount of wine, it all came down to this. Linvalor had two disks remaining, "
"while Anequina had only one.\n"
"\n"
"The opponents rattled their remaining disks in their respective tumblers. "
"Then, with much deliberation, they smacked the tumblers down to set the "
"disks so that either their \"\"sword\"\" side or \"\"shield\"\" side was "
"face up under the container. Linvalor lifted the tumbler slightly and took a "
"quick peek underneath—one each of a sword and shield—before covering his two "
"disks again. Anequina simply smiled, not bothering to look at all. Linvalor "
"knew there were two of one symbol between them. He just had to accurately "
"guess whether it was two swords or two shields. \"\"Two …\"\" he started, "
"trying to glean anything from Anequina's calm expression. \"\"… shields,\"\" "
"he finished, but it came out more like a question than a statement.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Oh, you are such a deceiver, captain,\"\" Anequina said, lifting her "
"tumbler to reveal her disk. A sword. Linvalor wiped sweat from his brow as "
"he plucked one of his disks and set it aside. \"\"Last toss of the disks, "
"captain,\"\" she said as they each added their single remaining disk to "
"their tumblers and started shaking them. Anequina blew the Sea Elf a kiss as "
"she slammed her tumbler down. With a growl, he did the same.\n"
"\n"
"Linvalor lifted his tumbler just enough to check. His disk was shield side "
"up. Once again, Anequina refused to check on her disk, so without bothering "
"to check, she said, \"\"Two shields, since it is obvious that between the "
"two of us, neither of us has a sword.\"\" They each lifted their tumblers to "
"reveal … they each tossed a shield.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Cheater!\"\" Linvalor bellowed as he stood, scattering the game "
"components and spilling what remained of the wine. \"\"Now, now, "
"captain,\"\" Anequina scolded, \"\"this one has heard that, if nothing else, "
"Sea Elves were as good as their word. Let us go and Anequina will return in "
"a year and a day for another game.\"\" Reluctantly, the captain agreed. "
"\"\"Next time, the outcome will be different, cat.\"\" \"\"This one looks "
"forward to it,\"\" she purred.\n"
"\n"
"As they departed with the Moon-Priest's daughter between them, Khunzar-ri "
"asked, \"\"You cheated, yes?\"\" Anequina gave him an innocent look. \"\"And "
"do you really plan to play him again?\"\" Anequina laughed, \"\"Of course! "
"How else will this one get one of those sleek pirate ships?\"\""

"By Hrodkir Mincemeat\n"
"\n"
"You like meat, yes? You want to live in warm climate too, like Hrodkir, so "
"you come to Elsweyr? Good choice. There is no snow here. This one was "
"trapper in Winterhold long ago, but he has lived in Anequina many years now, "
"learning the language and teaching savannah cats how to catch prey without "
"pouncing. Hrodkir cannot draw, so he will just tell you what to catch. He "
"wishes you luck.\n"
"\n"
"Jerboa\n"
"\n"
"There are many mice in Elsweyr. Hrodkir thinks this is why there are also "
"many cats. Mice and rats aren't usually good eating, Except maybe skeevers, "
"but in Anequina there are bunny-mice called Jerboa that make good meatballs. "
"Truthfully, Hrodkir does not know if they are more bunny or mouse. Have long "
"ears and legs, but also long tails. This one thinks you will know them when "
"you see them. You will see lots of them. They breed quickly. Take two or "
"three daily for meals and they won't even notice. String noose laid over "
"mouth of their den is sure to catch one by nightfall. Hrodkir thinks they "
"taste a little sweet. Must be the moon-sugar they get into.\n"
"\n"
"Fennec Foxes\n"
"\n"
"There are also many large-eared foxes that Hrodkir thinks look like cats, "
"but they are not cats, so you can eat them without getting in trouble. This "
"one thought huge ears were silly, but they work. These foxes are very hard "
"to hunt, but Hrodkir has great method for catching. Gather some scorpions "
"for foxes to eat. They like scorpions. Cut off stingers. Mince garlic and "
"onions. Rub paste on scorpions, good and thick. Paste is poison to foxes. "
"Kills and seasons them at the same time! Foxes remind Hrodkir of wolf, but "
"more tender and less gamey.\n"
"\n"
"Fellrunner\n"
"\n"
"Big birds. Not horse big. Goat to deer big. They have long legs and necks, "
"but tiny wings. These birds don't fly or swim. They run. Fast. But very "
"stupid. Hrodkir herds them into trip wires with loud shouting. At full speed "
"they fall and break things. Fragile bones. Fellrunners make good, lean "
"jerky, but are tricky to cook without getting dry. Keep bacon grease for "
"basting.\n"
"\n"
"Terror Birds\n"
"\n"
"Bigger birds. Kind of vulture-lizard. They don't fly, but run, leap, and "
"claw. Very strong. Hrodkir has seen one trample a lion. Very smart, too. "
"Hard to trap and dangerous to hunt. This one found one dead and tried meat. "
"Tough, stringy, greasy, and tastes like used boots. Best avoided. Not worth "
"trouble.\n"
"\n"
"Thorn Gecko\n"
"\n"
"Like other geckos but has thorns. Good name, yes? They hunt bugs during day "
"and move quick, but at night they look for warmth and are sluggish. Look for "
"dark stone. You find some resting. Grab them with little trouble. Watch "
"thorns, though. Also taste like other geckos. If you like gecko meat, you "
"will like thorn gecko meat.\n"
"\n"
"Daggerback\n"
"\n"
"Bristly boar found lots of places. Tusks and quills all around head. Dig a "
"hole. Place blanket over it. Weigh down with rocks. Scatter sand and "
"mushrooms on top of blanket. If hole deep enough, you eat well for weeks. "
"Strong taste. Best in stew.\n"
"\n"
"Desert Alit\n"
"\n"
"Mouth with legs. Hrodkir has seen them all over Tamriel. This one thinks "
"desert ones are meanest. Big mouth to feed and not much to eat. Nets traps "
"work best. Once entangled, they can't escape. Skin is tough, but meat is "
"good, if chewy.\n"
"\n"
"Sep Adder\n"
"\n"
"Hrodkir had not seen these before coming to Elsweyr. He was told they are "
"also found in Hammerfell. Large desert snakes, usually brown scaled, with "
"wings on their backs. They don't fly much. Mostly use wings to scare "
"predators and shade head. They can pounce from great distance, though. "
"Normally wouldn't try to net snake, but wings are easily trapped. Easy to "
"skin and cook. Like scaly, scary hens.\n"
"\n"
"Lions\n"
"\n"
"Not all cats in Elsweyr are Khajiit, but more cats are Khajiit than you "
"might expect. This one can't usually tell unless the cat is clothed. Hrodkir "
"suggests not eating cats while in Elsweyr. Khajiit think it in poor taste. "
"Meat is actually tasty, though."

"Khunzar-ri and the Twelve Ogres\n"
"\n"
"Transcribed by Aneshi, Keeper of Legends for the 16 Kingdoms\n"
"\n"
"One day Khunzar-ri stopped by an adeptorium near Dune hoping to find shelter "
"and sustenance after a long and tiring journey. Unfortunately, the "
"adeptorium was overrun by a dozen drooling ogres.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"This isn't good,\"\" Khunzar-ri said as he watched the gluttonous ogres "
"as they ransacked the premises from a nearby hill. He was particularly "
"concerned when he saw them break into the stores of moon-sugar double rum. "
"He was especially looking forward to the adepts' potent beverage. Then "
"Khunzar-ri had an idea.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Oh, brave and mighty ogres,\"\" Khunzar-ri called out. \"\"Those barrels "
"you found. Can't you tell the rum has spoiled? I can smell that the liquid "
"has gone bad from way over here!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Spoiled?\"\" asked the largest ogre dubiously. \"\"You can't know that. "
"We haven't even cracked open a barrel yet!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Am I not Khajiit?\"\" Khunzar-ri asked with all sincerity. \"\"And "
"aren't Khajiit known for their most excellent sense of smell?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"That is true,\"\" said another ogre. \"\"Everyone knows about cats and "
"smell.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"But I am thirsty!\"\" complained the largest ogre. \"\"I do not want to "
"drink spoiled rum!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I have a suggestion,\"\" said Khunzar-ri. \"\"There is a Nedic fort a "
"short distance from here. They have an entire warehouse full of rum and "
"other spirits, and I did not smell a hint of spoilage when I passed by. To "
"the contrary, it all smelled delicious!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Happy to hear it, the largest ogre ran toward the Nedic fort, the adepts' "
"rum forgotten. With nary a pause, the other eleven ogres followed.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Now,\"\" said Khunzar-ri, \"\"let us open that barrel and have a "
"drink!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"What about the ogres?\"\" asked one of the adepts.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"What about them? They are the Nedes problem now.\"\" And with that "
"Khunzar-ri proceeded to drink the entire barrel, one mug at a time."

"\n"
"Of all the far-flung provinces of this great Empire, none may be quite as "
"welcoming as Elsweyr. Don't let their beastly countenance fool you. The "
"Khajiit are, by and large, a friendly and gracious people, eager to host "
"visitors and entice travelers with all manner of goods and services. If you "
"wish to vacation in a land of carefree ease, gentle breezes, and plentiful "
"warmth, look no further!\n"
"\n"
"Should you travel there from Cyrodiil, you'll enter the venerable province "
"of Anequina—one of the two major regions that make up the province of "
"Elsweyr—and find the pastoral town of Riverhold waiting to welcome you.\n"
"\n"
"This bustling border town is a frequent stop for caravanners and travelers "
"passing between Elsweyr and the greater Empire. The spacious town square "
"acts as an open-air market where a wide array of goods are peddled right off "
"the wagon by their enterprising owners, and the offerings vary by the hour "
"as traders depart on their journeys or arrive from them. There's plenty to "
"do other than haggle, of course. The Banished Regrets inn frequently offers "
"a selection of imported libations to ease a parched throat and the quiet "
"atmosphere of the Temple of the Moon's Blessing is sure to give you a "
"moment's peace. There is also a burgeoning House of Histories, which "
"promises to exhibit the long and storied history of the Khajiit upon its "
"completion.\n"
"\n"
"Once you're refreshed and ready to resume your travels, a short caravan ride "
"east of Riverhold will lead you to the capital of Anequina: Rimmen.\n"
"\n"
"On the road to Rimmen, you'll begin to see that the land of Elsweyr is as "
"diverse as the Khajiit themselves. The closer you draw to the flourishing "
"city, the more apparent it becomes that here the arid savannah has been "
"tamed and the dry grassland has given way to lush greenery and flooded "
"steppes of cane paddies. Within Rimmen's high walls, you will see that the "
"misconception that Khajiit have an aversion to water is greatly exaggerated. "
"Here trees and tropical plants thrive along artificial canals that weave "
"throughout the city, supplied by a great aqueduct that spans the entire "
"kingdom. Older than the city itself, it's a wonder constructed in an era "
"long behind us. Lounging along the waterways is a favorite pass-time for "
"residents and visitors alike. Rimmen's year-round warmth and largely clear "
"skies make it a popular destination for vacationers from all around the "
"Empire. Spend one day here and you'll find that Khajiit hospitality is "
"second to none!\n"
"\n"
"If you're feeling adventurous and up for a considerable hike, you can while "
"away your time following the Anequina Aqueduct through the countryside. "
"While you're touring the wonders of Anequina, you simply cannot miss the "
"Scar, quite literally, an expansive canyon carved straight through the "
"middle of the region. The sight of it from above or below is breathtaking in "
"its magnitude and one you won't want to miss. Though you may find the sight "
"of a vast water source that's just out of reach too much to bear in the arid "
"scrub-lands that lie to the west.\n"
"\n"
"Before you endeavor to traverse the winding chasm that is the Scar, it would "
"behoove you to stop by the city of Orcrest. While Riverhold is the gateway "
"to Anequina, and Rimmen the capital, Orcrest is the center of commerce. This "
"ancient, walled city rests along the cliffs of the Scar, outstretching its "
"welcoming arms (its great bridges) to bring the disparate regions of "
"Anequina together. Traders from all over the kingdom, and beyond come here "
"to peddle their goods to their counterparts from neighboring Pellitine, "
"Valenwood, and Cyrodiil. Few things cannot be found for sale here. It's said "
"that Khajiit here will part with their tail for the right price, but I'll "
"admit that my fluency with Ta'agra is not the best.\n"
"\n"
"You may have tired hustle and bustle of city life, there are plenty of "
"quieter places to take in the scenery. Placid moon-sugar farms dot the "
"meadows of Merryvale, where the cane stalks sway along with the songs of "
"cheery harvesters in the cool breeze. Khajiiti temples to the Divines are "
"both numerous and strikingly beautiful. Sunspire in particular dwarfs any "
"cathedral in Kvatch. Though if you want a truly unique Elsweyr experience, "
"spend some time meditating with the monks of one of their adeptoriums and "
"take in the feats of strength, agility, and skill that these dedicated "
"ascetics are capable of.\n"
"\n"
"If my words have brought you this far, I hope you'll take a few steps more "
"and begin your travels to one of the most wondrous provinces in the Empire!"

"By Tendwuayne, Sapiarch of Foreign Customs\n"
"\n"
"Despite its status as one of the Elsweyr's most enduring traditions, the "
"origins of Khajiiti martial arts, or \"\"Claw-Dances,\"\" remain murky at "
"best. The burning of Corinthe's Grand Archive by Merrunz cultists in 1E 463 "
"destroyed most of the region's Merethic records, making the work of cultural "
"historians like myself very difficult indeed. Luckily, Darloc Brae, the "
"famed conqueror and so-called Golden Beast of Anequina, took great pains to "
"secure what histories remained, placing them in vaults and smaller archives "
"throughout Elsweyr. Gaining access to these archives is no small feat for a "
"High Elf, I can tell you. But years of dogged persistence have borne some "
"meager fruits.\n"
"\n"
"From what I can ascertain, life in Merethic Era Elsweyr was a toilsome "
"affair. At that time, the famed sixteen kingdoms of the Khajiit were little "
"more than competing fiefdoms, ruled by a cruel hunter-aristocracy. Severe "
"droughts and periods of famine struck Anequina with pitiless regularity, and "
"the constant feuding of the hunter-nobles resulted in widespread military "
"conscription—robbing peasant communities of youthful labor and prompting "
"still greater famine across the region. The only check placed on the hunt-"
"lords resided in the Temples of Two-Moons Dance. Khajiiti adepts and other "
"Torval clergy wielded significant cultural influence, and occasionally used "
"it to vex or even overthrow particularly vicious hunt-lords. The aristocracy "
"chafed at these intrusions, but knew better than to challenge the adepts "
"directly.\n"
"\n"
"At some point in the high days of the Merethic Era, a particularly ruthless "
"hunt-lord named Takanzin the Striped Death paid a flock of criminals to set "
"fire to the Rawl'kha Temple. The clergy displaced by the blaze immediately "
"fielded a small army of warrior-adepts to punish those responsible. The "
"details of the conflict are lost to the ages, but the resolution was quite "
"clear: Takanzin's forces quashed the priestly uprising and drove the "
"remaining adepts out of the Kingdom of Dune altogether.\n"
"\n"
"Seizing the opportunity to be done with the adepts' meddling once and for "
"all, the other hunt-lords across the northern tier of what is now Elsweyr "
"instituted a policy of weapon confiscation. They cited the violence in "
"Rawl'kha as evidence of the clergy's treasonous intentions and brutally "
"suppressed any religious order that refused to comply.\n"
"\n"
"After an extended period of deep despondency and contemplation, the adepts "
"turned inward—cutting ties with the politics of the age and focusing "
"entirely on self-perfection. Religious meditation was an essential part of "
"that journey.\n"
"\n"
"In many cultures, meditation is a quiet and motionless activity. Not so for "
"Khajiit. Their nervous energy and focus on raw physicality drove them to "
"adopt a lyrical, dance-like form of meditation. It couldn't have taken long "
"for the adepts' dancing to transform into something akin to a martial art. "
"Smooth, meditative dance gave way to swift claw-strikes and daring leaps. "
"This should come as no surprise, given the Khajiits' predatory instincts. "
"People possessing claws and fangs cannot be expected to remain peaceful "
"forever!\n"
"\n"
"After centuries of isolation, the adepts emerged from their cloisters, "
"bristling with martial skill and wisdom. By this point, the hunter-"
"aristocracy was nearing its end. Disparities in wealth and influence had "
"reached a tipping point, paving the way for a long-overdue public uprising. "
"The adepts wasted no time sharing their hard-earned skills with the "
"beleaguered peasantry. Within the span of a few generations, the adepts' "
"martial arts were completely ubiquitous. All the people needed was a spark.\n"
"\n"
"In the latter days of the Merethic Era, feuding hunt-lords from Meirvale and "
"Helkarn drafted thousands of peasants into military service, bringing about "
"one of the worst famines in Elsweyr's history. After three years of futile "
"conflict, the armies of both lords turned on their masters, toppling the "
"aristocracy in a rain of slashing claws, wind-kicks, and bone-breaking "
"punches.\n"
"\n"
"Before long, peasant uprisings broke out in nearby Riverhold, Orcrest, "
"Verkarth, Bruk'ra, and Ne Quin-al. Within a century, the regal hunter caste "
"that had reigned over Elsweyr for thousands of years fell from power.\n"
"\n"
"We know that the glorious dream of a farming utopia never took hold in "

"As Transcribed By Tiburr, Record Keeper of the Rimmen Mage's Guild\n"
"\n"
"[Transcriber's Note: Tales of the Angry Alfiq have a long tradition in "
"Khajiiti storytelling. No one knows quite how many tales there are in total, "
"given that storytellers are constantly adding to the collection. Aside from "
"the titular character, commonalities of these stories include their short "
"length, non-sequitur nature, and humorous endings.\n"
"\n"
"To the bafflement of some, these stories are not meant to teach moral "
"lessons or cultural values, as many folktales do. Rather, the adventures of "
"the Angry Alfiq are more akin to elaborate jokes. So, as is the Khajiiti "
"tradition, open your ears and prepare to laugh as I tell you some of the "
"most popular Angry Alfiq stories to date.]\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"The Angry Alfiq and the Senche\n"
"\n"
"One day the Angry Alfiq met a very pretty Senche. She was more beautiful "
"than any Khajiit of any furstock he had seen before. Right at that moment, "
"he knew that he would do anything to win her affection.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You are too meek!\"\" laughed his Suthay cousin. \"\"How will you woo "
"her?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You are too weak!\"\" laughed his Cathay sister. \"\"She will crush "
"you!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You are too small!\"\" laughed his Pahmar brother. \"\"How will you "
"reach her?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"But the Angry Alfiq was determined to win the pretty Senche's love. He "
"trained day and night to become strong. He read many books on romance and "
"affection. He bought four boots, each with very thick heels. And with these "
"preparations done, he went off to win the heart of his lady love.\n"
"\n"
"He returned the next morning with a broken heart and a broken hip.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"The Angry Alfiq and the Lute\n"
"\n"
"One day the Angry Alfiq met a traveling bard. She played and sung more "
"beautifully than any bard he had heard before. Right at that moment, he knew "
"that he would do anything to play music by her side.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You could play the tambourine,\"\" said the bard. \"\"Just shake it with "
"your mouth!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"But the Angry Alfiq did not want to play the tambourine.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You could play the drum,\"\" said the bard. \"\"Just bat it with your "
"paw!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"But the Angry Alfiq did not want to play the drum.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Well, what other instrument could you play with a body such as "
"yours?\"\" asked the bard.\n"
"\n"
"The Angry Alfiq answered that he wished to play the lute, for it was the "
"most elegant and sweet-sounding instrument of all. \n"
"\n"
"The bard just laughed. She could not imagine how one so little and with such "
"clumsy paws would be able to play a lute. It was impossible, simply "
"impossible!\n"
"\n"
"But the more she laughed, the more determined the Angry Alfiq was to prove "
"her wrong. He demanded that the bard hand over her own lute so that he may "
"try to play. Amused, the bard obliged.\n"
"\n"
"The Angry Alfiq popped out a single, sharp claw with a smirk. In one quick "
"stroke, he strummed it across every single string, cleaning slicing each and "
"every one.\n"
"\n"
"And then it was the Angry Alfiq who laughed and laughed as he ran down the "
"street, the enraged bard not very far behind.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"The Angry Alfiq and the Beard\n"
"\n"
"One day the Angry Alfiq saw the largest, bushiest beard he had ever seen. It "
"was thick and black, reaching all the way down to the stomach of Khajiit who "
"grew it. Right at that moment, he knew that he would do anything to have "
"such a magnificent beard.\n"
"\n"
"But try and try as he might, the Angry Alfiq could grow no more than the "
"scruff of fur already adorning his chin. He tried many tonics and even "
"spells, but nothing seemed to work.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"This one will help!\"\" said his Suthay cousin. \"\"But you must pay "
"gold, even though we are family.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The Angry Alfiq agreed to these terms and his Suthay cousin went to work. "
"Using tar to make them stick, the cousin placed feather upon feather on the "
"Angry Alfiq's chin. When at last she was done, she pulled a mirror from her "
"pack.\n"
"\n"
"The Angry Alfiq hissed in anger, swiping his sharp claws across his Suthay "
"cousin's sensitive nose. As she cried and cried, he took all her gold along "
"with his own and left her household in a huff.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"This one will help!\"\" said his Cathay sister. \"\"But still you must "
"pay, even though we are siblings.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Once again, the Angry Alfiq agreed to these terms. Using honey this time, "
"the sister placed clump after clump of cotton on his chin. When at last she "
"was done, she picked him up and let him peer into the mirror on her wall.\n"
"\n"
"The Angry Alfiq yowled in anger, swiping his sharp claws across his Cathay "
"sister's hand. As she cried and cried, he took all her gold along with his "
"own and left her room in a huff.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I will help!\"\" said his Pahmar brother. \"\"But if I succeed, you must "
"give me all the gold you now have.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Hesitantly, the Angry Alfiq agreed. And so his Pahmar brother went to the "
"bearded stranger and knocked him out, allowing the brother to deftly cut off "
"every hair from the stranger's chin. He presented this large tuft of hair to "
"the Angry Alfiq with a toothy grin.\n"
"\n"
"The Angry Alfiq growled and growled, but still he gave up his gold, for it "
"was true that his Pahmar brother had gifted him with a mighty fine beard."

"CHAPTER 3\n"
"Juha-ri of White Sand smelled his death on the desert wind and told the "
"eldest of his acolytes, the once-youth who sought to learn the Dance of "
"Shadows, that his time had come. The eldest, who by the dutiful teachings of "
"his master and the savagery of time had grown wretched and wise, went to the "
"banks of the Darkarn River to fashion a litter of reeds. \n"
"\n"
"The eldest bore the Sage of White Sand up the steps of the Dancing Moon "
"Temple, and as he did so the brothers and sisters of our order followed. "
"They burned moonlight in their censers. Fume and chanting wreathed the stone "
"and sand and bodies. When the eldest had borne him to the mountaintop, to "
"the vault where Anequina Sharp-Tongue had danced the last Dance of Shadows, "
"the chanting stopped. The smoke of moonlight poured from our censers and the "
"room was shrouded in silent gloam.\n"
"\n"
"Juha-ri, who was made lame through his long years of devotion, stood and "
"tottered before the eldest on unsteady paws. He asked if the eldest recalled "
"what brought him to the Dancing Shadow Temple all those years before. And "
"the eldest nodded, for he had studied the sutras and knew that years were as "
"brief as a single flap of a fletcherfly's wings in winter. \n"
"\n"
"And returning the eldest's nod with his own, Juha-ri stood perfectly still. "
"In the soul of the Sage of White Sand the eldest saw movement, chaotic and "
"beautiful. It echoed through the lattice, swelling with reverberation off "
"the fumes of moonlight and the great and small vertices. As the fuming "
"moonlight burned his lungs, the eldest saw the Dance of Shadows was no "
"demand nor supplication. It was an existence, nearly close to perfection. "
"The lattice mirrored and perfected the form, and in doing so was changed, "
"for a time.\n"
"\n"
"And as it started, so did the Dance of Shadows end. Juha-ri collapsed, his "
"soul gone to the Sand Behind the Stars. The eldest heeded the lesson well."

"He was a young one no longer. Years as acolyte to the Sage of White Sand had "
"left a mark upon his corporeal self: a face that knew the vitality of youth "
"was sunken. Fur was matted and coarse without its daily oiling. But the "

"A young one came to us and, with due reverence, asked Juha-ri of White Sand "
"if he could learn the Dance of Shadows, for he had heard as many had before "
"of the great dance of Anequina Sharp-Tongue, boon companion to Khunzar-ri. "
"With a tongue full of platitude and supplication, he begged Juha-ri to share "

"\n"
"And Juha-ri gave the youth the smile he always gave to the young, one of "
"sadness and pity. He asked the youth, how does one instruct a serpent to "
"walk? How does one tell an owl to make fire, or an ape to pray? The youth "
"took Juha-ri's meaning. He thanked the great Sage of White Sand for his "
"words and began his long walk home.\n"
"\n"
"Juha-ri called to the young one, and though the Sage of White Sand spoke "
"only the barest whisper the wind carried the voice as though it had "
"descended from Jone and Jode themselves. Juha-ri offered to share with the "
"youth his knowledge of the Dance. The young one was confused. No serpent "
"could be instructed to walk. No owl can make fire. Were these not likened to "
"teaching the Dance of Shadows?\n"
"\n"
"The Sage of White Sand nodded. A serpent will always be a serpent, an owl "
"always an owl. But the soul may become many things, though it may take "
"lifetimes to become them. Many consider such a price too dear to pay, and "
"they will never come to know the Dance of Shadows. \n"
"\n"
"The youth nodded and stood in contemplation. And when Juha-ri returned to "
"the Dancing Shadow temple, the youth followed."

"As Retold by Nalae-Polek, Poet Laureate to Potentate Versidue-Shaie\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa despaired all day. She had come so close to losing her second "
"trial, and now she was to face a third. Failure to pass this last trial "
"would result in a grave punishment. Perhaps even her death.\n"
"\n"
"She thought of all of her options. Was there was a priest could protect her "
"from the spirits? A potion that would let her stay awake forever? But the "
"more she thought, the less realistic each idea became.\n"
"\n"
"So afraid was Kail-Perwa, she did not fall asleep until well until the night."
"\n"
"\n"
"She awoke into a dream once more. Again, she was greeted by a land of "
"endless water and a sky of endless white. But this time, the warrior in gold "
"stood before her in all his glory. In his hands was a mighty black sword, so "
"large that Kail-Perwa could never hope to lift it.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You have passed two trials,\"\" said the warrior in gold, his voice as "
"proud and strong as his bearing. \"\"But you have yet to pass mine. Do you "
"accept my judgment, descendant?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa nodded quickly, just once. She knew it would be useless to object."
"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You have proven to be clever twice through your actions,\"\" continued "
"the warrior in gold as he slung his mighty sword across his shoulders. "
"\"\"But how clever are your words? This will be your last trial, Kail-Perwa. "
"Convince me that you are more clever than all living and all dead.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"For the first time in her life, Kail-Perwa did not know what to say. What "
"words could she weave to convince this spirit of such cleverness?\n"
"\n"
"\"\"To go forward, sometimes you must look back,\"\" the woman in red had "
"told her.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Seek what is true, not what is obvious,\"\" the grandfather in blue had "
"said.\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa closed her eyes and thought. She had overcome two trials to prove "
"herself more clever than any other. But was that truly the purpose of her "
"hardships? Using all of her cleverness, using all of her wit, she thought "
"about what she had learned and what she must do.\n"
"\n"
"When next her eyes opened, Kail-Perwa knew she had found the truth.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I can't,\"\" she told the warrior in gold, her hands trembling slightly. "
"\"\"I can't convince you that I'm more clever than all living and all dead."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Oh?\"\" asked the warrior in gold, his voice even. \"\"And why is "
"that?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Because I'm not,\"\" answered Kail-Perwa. \"\"If I was truly so clever, "
"I would never make such a boast. There are many I have never met, and many I "
"will never meet. And to condemn them to be less clever than I is foolishness."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I see,\"\" said the warrior in gold, his face revealing nothing. \"\"And "
"is this all you have to say?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa bowed deeply, her head hung in shame. \"\"I know now that such "
"boasts are an insult our family's good name. I apologize.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And with this, the warrior's face broke into a grin. His armor transformed "
"into noble robes, his face growing a long, full beard. And that was when "
"Kali-Perwa realized that the spirit before her was none other than General "
"Haro-Banar, the most honored of her ancestors.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"You have humbled yourself before me, despite risk of punishment,\"\" "
"said General Haro-Banar. \"\"And for that, I will forgive your "
"transgressions. Live modestly, my descendant, for there are none so clever "
"as those who realize their own limitations.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Thank you, General Haro-Banar,\"\" said Kail-Perwa, her heart filled "
"with gratitude. \"\"That is a lesson I shall never forget.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And so Kail-Perwa finally awoke to the wisdom of her ancestors, and all was "
"well."

"Kail-Perwa bowed to the ancestral spirit and politely said, \"\"Greetings, "
"grandfather.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Ah, Kail-Perwa. You have come at last to meet this old man,\"\" the "
"grandfather in blue greeted. \"\"Please, have a seat so we may begin your "
"trial.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"With only a moment's hesitation, Kail-Perwa did as she was bid. She found no "
"trickery in her steps this time, and easily found her way to the table where "
"she took a seat.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Now, as for your trial,\"\" the grandfather continued, \"\"It is very "
"simple. We will play a single game of tihasae. Your only goal is to stop my "
"victory. Do you understand?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa nodded, though her stomach clenched. She had played tihasae many "
"times, this was true. It was a game which required great cunning to win, and "
"Kail-Perwa won it often. But could she prevail against this elderly spirit, "
"who had both wisdom and cunning on his side?\n"
"\n"
"With a swipe of his hand, the grandfather in blue summoned a tihasae board. "
"The game pieces were bone white, contrasting against the dark browns of the "
"board. He gestured towards Kail-Perwa, inviting her to take the first move. "
"And so the game began.\n"
"\n"
"It was not an easy battle. Kail-Perwa's hands shook as she moved her pieces "
"across the board. Every time she went in for an attack, the grandpa in blue "
"was there with a impassable defense. And when he struck her pieces, he "
"struck mercilessly. Quickly, quicker than Kail-Perwa thought possible, she "
"was on the verge of defeat.\n"
"\n"
"At last, Kail-Perwa found herself one turn from losing. There was no way she "
"could win, no way she could even escape defeat. This, she was clever enough "
"to see.\n"
"\n"
"But must she win? Suddenly, Kail-Perwa's eyes opened wide. The grandfather "
"in blue said to stop his victory. If this was truly a simple task, did she "
"truly need to win against him?\n"
"\n"
"Without another thought, Kail-Perwa swiped her hand across the board. The "
"tihasae pieces scattered into the water with soft plops, sinking further and "
"further than should have been possible. With that simple action, there was "
"no way for the game to conclude. There was no way for either competitor to "
"win.\n"
"\n"
"The grandfather in blue chuckled and said, \"\"Very good, Kail-Perwa. With "
"one move, you have stopped my victory. Simple, was it not?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa panted, her breaths ragged and short. She had nearly failed the "
"trial, and it was very possible that such a failure could have resulted in "
"her death.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"And now a lesson for you,\"\" the grandfather in blue continued, nodding "
"his head. \"\"Seek what is true, not what is obvious. Let this lesson be "
"your guiding words, for there is still one trial ahead.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And with that, Kail-Perwa awoke to the morning sun."

"As Retold by Nalae-Polek, Poet Laureate to Potentate Versidue-Shaie\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa found it very difficult to sleep that night. The warrior in gold "
"had claimed that she would be visited by three of her cleverest ancestors. "
"Should Kail-Perwa fail to prove her wit to all three of them, she would be "
"punished. But how would she be punished?\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa was clever enough to know that the warrior in gold who visited "
"her was an ancestral spirit. As such, the spirit had the power to grant her "
"both great fortune or misfortune, depending on his ruling. He could even "
"drag Kail-Perwa to the afterlife, should he be truly angered.\n"
"\n"
"Would she be able to pass these three trials? Would she be killed if she "
"failed? Such questions kept Kail-Perwa awake late into the night, until at "
"last she fell asleep.\n"
"\n"
"When Kail-Perwa next awakened, she was not truly awake. She was inside a "
"dream, of this she was sure, but her consciousness had never been so clear "
"and aware in a dream as it was now. Truly, it felt like she had been "
"transported into another realm.\n"
"\n"
"And what a strange realm it was. The land around her was covered in a thin "
"layer of water, cold against her feet. The sky above was an endless white. "
"The only distinguishing feature was a twisted, black tree, jutting out from "
"the water. And next to this tree was a lone woman, dressed in red.\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa instantly knew this was the first spirit to would judge her.\n"
"\n"
"The woman in red smiled. She was young and beautiful with a noble bearing, "
"and when she spoke, her voice was like the wind which foretells a great "
"storm.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I have come to judge you,\"\" said the woman in red, \"\"for you have "
"claimed to be more clever than I. As your ancestor, I bear right to test "
"that cleverness. Do you accept my judgement?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa bowed deeply and said, \"\"I do.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"My task is simple, then. You must walk to me. This is all.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa worried her lip, for she doubted the task was as simple as the "
"woman in red declared. Still, the only action she could take was to move "
"forward. But as Kail-Perwa walked, she quickly found herself moving further "
"and further away. It was if the tree and the woman in red leaned away from "
"her, just as swiftly as she walked forward.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"All is not as it seems,\"\" thought Kail-Perwa. \"\"There is a trick to "
"this place that I have yet to see.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"So she looked behind her, and saw but endless water. She looked above, and "
"saw but endless sky. But then she looked below, and saw her own reflection. "
"And this reflection, as impossible as it may have been, was facing away from "
"the woman in red.\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa could almost laugh! What a simple trick. As she moved forward, "
"her reflection was moving her away from the woman in red. In order to walk "
"towards the spirit, she must move her reflection in the correct direction, "
"not herself.\n"
"\n"
"And so Kail-Perwa turned away from the woman in red and began to walk. It "
"was an odd sensation, as her steps seemed to pull the land ahead of her "
"further away. Very quickly, she heard a tinkling laugh near her ear. She "
"turned around, now face to face with the mysterious spirit.\n"
"\n"
"The woman in red smiled and said, \"\"Very good, Kail-Perwa. You have solved "
"my task. But tell me, do you realize the lesson learned?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa bit her lip and shook her head, for she did not know.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"To go forward, sometimes you must go back,\"\" the woman in red gently "
"explained. \"\"Let this lesson be your guiding words, for there are still "
"two trials ahead.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And with that, Kail-Perwa awoke to the morning sun."

"A Study in Akaviri Mystique\n"
"By Magnate Feina-Darak\n"
"\n"
"When the Khajiit and Rim-Men of Northern Elsweyr granted asylum to the "
"Akaviri refugees of the fading Potentate, the first of the arrivals were "
"bequeathed the unused crypts west of the capital. In these, they would bury "
"the dead that did not survive the flight from the Imperial City.\n"
"\n"
"The monarchs of the region, King Savlian of Rimmen and Queen Padala of the "
"Anequina Khajiit, decreed that the Akaviri survivors would be resettled "
"within the capital and the fertile hills to the south. They brought with "
"them many of their retainers, full-blooded Imperials who were nevertheless "
"devoted to their former rulers.\n"
"\n"
"Though Rimmen already had an eclectic society as a crossroads of Imperial "
"and Khajiiti trade, the strange aesthetics, culture, and even food of the "
"Akaviri settlers changed the city forever. The most unusual contribution of "
"the Akaviri, if one can call it that, was the construction of the Tonenaka "
"Shrine in the northern district of Rimmen.\n"
"\n"
"Built with Khajiiti stonework influenced by Akaviri architectural styles, "
"the Tonenaka Shrine became something of a cultural touchstone for the "
"remaining Akaviri settlers and their former Imperial subjects. Their "
"patriarchs commissioned the construction of ten thousand statuettes of "
"carved stone, bringing sculptors and engineers from across southern Tamriel "
"to aid in the project.\n"
"\n"
"Indeed, the vast wealth that these Akaviri settlers brought with them to "
"finance the project greatly increased Rimmen's prosperity. However, as the "
"years passed, so few of the Akaviri remained that only five lived to see the "
"Shrine's completion. Most had interbred with the Imperial population or "
"settled farther south in the village of Hakoshae.\n"
"\n"
"When the final statue was placed, these five Akaviri entered the Tonenaka "
"Shrine and sealed its doors behind them, placing powerful wards upon it to "
"prevent entry. This wasn't part of the original agreement between the Rimmen "
"authorities and the Akaviri builders, but with the promise of gold their ire "
"was assuaged.\n"
"\n"
"The Shrine remains sealed to this day, with only occasional work being done "
"to its exterior to prevent degradation of its marvelous stonework."

"As Retold by Nalae-Polek, Poet Laureate to Potentate Versidue-Shaie\n"
"\n"
"Once in the land of Akaviri, there was a clever woman named Kail-Perwa. She "
"was known to spin words the way a spider spins its web, alluring and "
"beautiful. But this clever tongue came with a boastful mouth.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Living or dead, there are none in Akavir who can match my wit!\"\" Kail-"
"Perwa proclaimed one day. \n"
"\n"
"Though her parents tried to silence her, Kail-Perwa would not take back her "
"words. She repeated them one, twice, thrice. And on that third time, her "
"words were so sure and loud that they echoed all the way into the afterlife.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"There are none so clever as I!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Though all of Kail-Perwa's ancestors were displeased with her words, one "
"spirit in particular took great offense. It was the spirit of General Haro-"
"Banar, a man who had won many great victories with his cleverness. The "
"general had always been modest about his accomplishments, and was displeased "
"that his descendant did not follow this example.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Kail-Perwa claims to be more clever than all, living and dead,\"\" the "
"general proclaimed. \"\"I shall travel to the world of the living and see if "
"these boastful words hold any truth.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"General Haro-Banar was well-honored by the living, and so his spirit was "
"strong enough to leave the afterlife and venture into the mortal realm. He "
"did so now, changing his ghostly appearance into that of a warrior dressed "
"in golden armor. Swift as the wind, he traveled to Kail-Perwa's village and "
"sought her out.\n"
"\n"
"The general found Kail-Perwa in the edge of the village, collecting herbs "
"for her house. For a moment he hesitated, for the general knew his "
"descendant to be as dutiful as she was clever. And so he resolved to give "
"her one last chance to renounce her boastful ways and live modestly.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I seek Kail-Perwa,\"\" said General Haro-Banar, making his presence "
"known. \"\"Be you her?\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa looked up and nodded, wiping the dirt from the palm of her hands. "
"\"\"Yes, I am she.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"It is said that you claim to be more clever than any living or any dead. "
"Be this true?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa stood to her full height and gave the general a confident smile. "
"\"\"Yes, it is true. There is none so clever as I.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"That is quite the claim to make,\"\" replied the general, his voice "
"growing cold. \"\"After all, how can you prove yourself against the "
"dead?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Kail-Perwa shrugged. \"\"Should any of the dead take offense from my words, "
"let them prove themselves to me! After all, cannot spirits visit the land of "
"the living?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Very well,\"\" said the general with a solemn nod. \"\"For the next "
"three nights, you will be visited by the cleverest of your ancestors. Prove "
"yourself to them, and your boast will become truth.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Suddenly, Kail-Perwa was afraid. How could this stranger make such a claim?\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Who are you?\"\" she asked, her voice trembling.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I am he who will meet you on the third night,\"\" said General Haro-"
"Banar, his voice mighty, his gaze unflinching. \"\"I am he who will "
"acknowledge you as cleverest of all, should you prove yourself so. And I am "
"he who will punish you, should your boasts be but clever lies.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"And with that, he was gone."

"By Dardarfin\n"
"\n"
"I've been given the unique and amazing opportunity to visit the more remote "
"areas of Northern Elsweyr in search of the elusive and dangerous terror "
"bird! Known locally as the khrasaat, these huge, flightless, carnivorous "
"birds tend to be incredibly aggressive, and are both intelligent and "
"beautiful to behold. I plan to get as close to one as possible. \n"
"\n"
"Lone Khajiit warriors often hunt these animals to prove their own ferocity, "
"but they die almost as often as they emerge victorious. These predators "
"definitely should not be trifled with, so I'll have to be extremely careful "
"when I approach one.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"I tracked a young male terror bird through the dense Tenmar jungle and have "
"been observing him all evening. What a majestic creature! Easily taller than "
"the biggest Orc or Nord I ever encountered, he must weigh ten times as much "
"as old Dardarfin! If only you could see him, his feathers fluffed and wings "
"spread! His long, arching neck swaying side to side, those dark, beady eyes "
"glinting in the moonlight. Could he be strutting for a mate? Has he detected "
"me and sending a warning?\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Whew that was a close call! It's a good thing these amazing birds are "
"flightless and can't climb trees or I would have been a goner for sure! So "
"it was not a warning at all, but a signal. No sooner had I decided to step a "
"little closer than I was suddenly surrounded by three more terror birds! He "
"wasn't alone after all, but acting as a scout for his pack. Truly "
"remarkable! What intelligence these creatures possess!\n"
"\n"
"The terror birds are well suited for skulking in shadows. Their feathers "
"appear as a very dark blue or dusty black, with a striking shock of red on "
"their throats, like a bib of blood. It makes for a terrifying sight! While "
"they had me trapped I saw one of them run down a senche, felling it with a "
"powerful kick. Then it brought that hook-like beak down with such force it "
"broke right through flesh and bone. Definitely not something I could learn "
"from a High-Elf zoo. They told me that terror birds eat moon-sugar plants. "
"Not true! These are blood-thirsty carnivores!\n"
"\n"
"Throughout the night I saw this pack attack everything that came near. I "
"figured something was amiss when they killed an antelope as a group and did "
"not eat it. There must be a nest nearby, so it's time to get a closer look. "
"Don't try this at home, it's extremely dangerous! \n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"That was frightening! I'm inside a small cave near the pack's hunting "
"grounds, and there is a nest here constructed of branches, torn fabric, and "
"feathers. Very intricate construction for a pack of mindless birds. A few "
"eggs occupy the nest as well. They look like dark onyx ovals with veins of "
"blue, each about the size of my head. Very lovely, indeed. Don't want to "
"touch these beauties, though, or my scent could make the parents reject or "
"even destroy the egg. I've seen such behavior in other species. "
"Unfortunately, one of the females has returned, so I'm stuck in this crevice "
"for the time being.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"These magnificent birds do not see well at night, so I took the opportunity "
"when darkness fell  to make my escape. It was a good thing, too, because "
"even more of the pack arrived right after that. Terror birds appear communal "
"in nature when it comes to caring for their young. \n"
"\n"
"It's time I made my way back to civilization. Poachers have come to Elsweyr "
"and would hunt these magnificent creatures for sport. I hope that you, my "
"readers, will join me in voicing your opposition to this kind of activity. "
"Animals deserve our respect and should be preserved, not murdered for "
"entertainment or out of fear. They are a valuable part of this environment "
"and it would be a shame for these incredible creatures to disappear."

"By Cornelius Clanius, Agent-Inspector of the Imperial Trade Service\n"
"\n"
"Moon-sugar! It's become more prevalent since the Dragonstar Caravan Company "
"began exporting it and the cats claiming it's a sacred but harmless cooking "
"ingredient. Yet have you seen what happens to those who sprinkle it on their "
"vegetables? They get excitable! And lethargic! Sometimes at once! The cats "
"are out to corrupt our youth with their sweet, poisonous 'sugar' I tell you. "
"It is a substance that must be banned from the Empire at once, for the good "
"of the children!\n"
"\n"
"However, I don't expect the Service to simply take my word for it, so the "
"ever-vigilant Cornelius Clanius has taken it upon himself to travel to "
"Elsweyr and expose the truth.\n"
"\n"
"The first impression of moon-sugar leaves little to be desired. It is a "
"grainy, powdery, crystal-like substance. Each 'piece' ranges in size from a "
"grain of rice to the size of one's thumb, and can be crushed or liquefied "
"for use in cooking. It has a white-to-silver sheen and despite being similar "
"in appearance to salt crystals, it is not translucent. Instead, when light "
"hits a solid fragment of moon-sugar, it seems to glow from within. \n"
"\n"
"While obviously merely refracted light, this may be responsible for the "
"cultural belief that moon-sugar consists of crystallized moonlight. Many "
"Khajiit believe that it is a gift from their gods. One popular tale speaks "
"of Azurah, their so-called 'Sugar God', whom brought the light of the moons "
"down to the marshes where it became sugar. Such primitive beliefs are easily "
"disproved with a little alchemy, but this is not one of yours truly's "
"talents.\n"
"\n"
"Venturing into the many small adeptoriums that dot Elsweyr's landscape, one "
"can find moon-sugar in use with various ceremonies. It is accepted in these "
"places that by consuming moon-sugar, they are imbibing portions of their "
"gods' souls. Many believe it can be used to grant visions when consumed in "
"various concoctions and combined with meditation. \n"
"\n"
"They state it can grant a state of enlightenment, but there is a more "
"terrible truth to this. These adeptoriums sometimes make use of skooma, "
"which they themselves refine from moon-sugar. The Moon-Bishops claim that "
"only they use it and it is never distributed, Cornelius Clanius was not born "
"yesterday! These babbling 'wisemen' claim to have visions granted through "
"the use of the drug. Could you imagine if that idea came into fashion within "
"the Empire? \n"
"\n"
"Did Cornelius Clanius, Agent-Inspector for the Imperial Trade Service ever "
"imbibe some of this moon-sugar, you ask? Did he even try it, to see if it is "
"as terrible as he seems to claim? Yes, he did and this is why he so "
"fervently suggests banning it! You see, the Khajiit put moon-sugar in "
"everything and eat it daily. They claim it's because they have a sweet tooth "
"and this satisfies their cravings. Poppycock! They're all drug addicts, "
"that's why. The more they use it, the more calloused they become to its "
"effects. We humans however? We are not calloused. We are susceptible to our "
"basest urges! \n"
"\n"
"When this devout and intent Agent ate some of this moon-sugar, do you know "
"what happened? He began to laugh hysterically! Such energy! Such enthusiasm! "
"Your very structured and precise Cornelius went out and hugged a lamp post! "
"Every claw mark was a fascinating discovery. The very texture was "
"enrapturing and I told everyone I came across about it. Imagine our youth, "
"sitting about, fondling inanimate objects! This is the future the Khajiit "
"want. It will cripple the Empire and pave the way for its inevitable "
"collapse. \n"
"\n"
"If it remains on the streets, we will have an entire generation of "
"degenerates who sit around, eating sweets, and discussing their feelings in "
"public. This is to say nothing of the lethargy that follows! No wonder the "
"Khajiit are lazy. Once this horrific sugar runs its course, it leaves one "
"drained and exhausted. It is simply not compatible with the Imperial work "
"ethic. \n"
"\n"
"No. This moon-sugar must be declared illegal at once. \n"
"\n"

"By Sulema, Initiate Scholar of the Pa'alatiin\n"
"\n"
"With respect to my mentors, who taught me to question everything. May we "
"forever approach lore with raised fur and unsheathed claws.\n"
"\n"
"Much of what scholars take to be true about Elsweyr is filtered through the "
"bias and perceptions of those of Cyrodiil and other non-Khajiit loremasters "
"and scholars. In fact, the geopolitical entities (which were originally "
"Khajiiti clan names) of Ne Quin-al and Pa'alatiin are more commonly known as "
"Anequina and Pellitine, respectively, due to the prevalence of Cyrodilic-"
"based studies, the demotion of importance of native lore by non-Khajiit "
"scholars, and the loss of native-based information. For a people who started "
"out as nomadic clans with static locations only for trade and other social "
"activities, attaching tribal names to locations as if these regions always "
"existed is problematic because it implies ownership over certain terrain "
"when, in fact, the clans originally moved as they needed to across the "
"province now called Elsweyr. Some would note that the names Ne Quin-al and "
"Pa'alatiin are Ta'agra, and while that is an acceptable observation, this "
"one feels it is more accurate to use these names for the people and the "
"Cyrodilic names of Anequina and Pellitine for their respective regions.\n"
"\n"
"Initially, a single Khajiiti Moon-Emperor ruled the region, and he later "
"gave rise to the famous and esteemed Darloc Brae in 1E 461. During these "
"days, sixteen Khajiiti clans roamed the province, and each performed a "
"function. For example, the Ne Quin-al consisted of warriors and trained "
"their members in martial disciplines and battle tactics. Some say that even "
"then these clans belonged to regions or realms, but that is an "
"oversimplification. Khajiit went where they were needed and wanted (or where "
"they wanted to be), more or less. For reference, please examine the lullaby "
"\"\"Hasa Zha'ja\"\" or \"\"The Name Dance,\"\" wherein the first known story "
"of how the clans earned their names exists.\n"
"\n"
"As the clans mastered their areas of expertise and as outside pressures "
"started pushing them into roles and more limited geographical areas, the "
"concept of tribal regions coalesced somewhat even within the Khajiiti way of "
"thinking. Thus it becomes more accurate to call both the people and the area "
"Ne Quin-al, but only \"\"more accurate\"\" — not completely accurate. The "
"poem \"\"Zhan Zhab\"\" (\"\"Wind Game\"\"), written by a clanless Khajiit in "
"1E 2243, shows the transition from clan name to place name as it unfolds, "
"but questions the need for this even as the language shifts within the poem.\n"
"\n"
"Then came the Thrassian Plague in 1E 2260. Due to the sheer number of "
"deaths, tribal function changed lest the Khajiit die out completely due to "
"starvation and other hardships. Sixteen clans became two and separated in "
"ideology as well as into geographical areas. Those of the Ne Quin'al "
"continued to roam and follow tribal customs, and they did so primarily in "
"the arid northern region. Those of the Pa'alatiin stayed in greener, "
"southern region and took on customs from other lands, especially Breton and "
"Cyrodiil, forming political and social structures that closer emulated those "
"peoples.\n"
"\n"
"All of the above provides context for the differences between the Khajiit of "
"Anequina and Pellitine. As those of Anequina continued to follow their "
"tribal traditions in the harsher climes of the north, they looked to the "
"south and saw only laziness, corruption, and weakness. By following the ways "
"of others and abandoning their traditions, the southern Khajiit proved to "
"the north just how weak-minded and feeble-bodied they had become. As for the "
"Pellitine Khajiit, they looked to the north and saw only parched landscapes "
"filled with militaristic barbarians. Rule through might alone was frowned "
"upon by these southerners, and though permanent structures existed in "
"Anequina, the fact that many still followed the paths of homeless nomads "
"only underscored to Pellitine just how unenlightened the northern Khajiit "
"were.\n"
"\n"
"Time passed, and the division between the northern and southern Khajiit grew."
" It took an act of marriage to start healing this rift. In 2E 309, rulers "
"Keirgo of Anequina and Eshita of Pellitine married, creating the current "
"province of Elsweyr. Though both peoples felt betrayed at this alliance, "
"railing at the fact that they were now tied to the fortunes of those who "
"seemingly did not share their values, the breach began to mend somewhat at "
"first. Then, the first blows to the province struck: the assassination of "
"Potentate Versidue-Shaie in Senchal in 2E 324, then the sacking of Ne Quin-"
"al and the resulting slaughter of most of the royal dynasty in 2E 326 by "
"Khajiiti rebels. Both these events weakened the fabric of Elsweyr's "
"political structure, creating an opening for further instability to come. "
"See, for further reference, the transcribed oral history of the period "
"entitled \"\"Zha'javan Ka'achin\"\" or \"\"The Dance of Dual Lands.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Perhaps the inherent nature of the Khajiit prevented an immediate collapse "
"of the government. Both those in Anequina and those in Pellitine tend toward "
"independent thinking and adaptability, which makes it harder to completely "
"prevail over them for any amount of time.\n"
"\n"
"But, illness comes to us all, and when the Knahaten Flu struck 2E 565, it "
"further damaged the shaky structure that was the Elsweyr government, "
"creating an opening for the takeover of the city-state of Rimmen and the "
"events that followed."

"By Nazala\n"
"\n"
"Returning to this land has been more difficult than this one imagined. When "
"the Night Mother called Nazala to her service, she had left this place full "
"of disease, death, and fetid waste. Now she returns to complete a contract "
"as old as her absence here. It is possible the target is already dead, but "
"the Sacrament must have an end, and so Nazala must find him.\n"
"\n"
"This one begins her search at the Ashen Scar, one of the many mass burial "
"grounds in Elsweyr. When the flu hit, this one saw them being filled. What "
"many call the Ashen Scar is the first of those. It is strong in spiritual "
"power, even one so base as Nazala can feel it. Her target came here looking "
"for something, but doubtful it was what he found. Undead lurk behind every "
"crumbling ruin, dangerous even for one who walks in shadow as this one does. "
"\n"
"\n"
"This one found no evidence that her target was among those buried here, so "
"she must look further. \n"
"\n"
"Her trail leads south, to a place of stone spires and rickety wooden bridges "
"locals call the Stitches. It was always a place for the less fortunate, the "
"undeserving, and the lawless to find refuge. Nazala first dragged her claws "
"through blood in this place. She remembers a little cub who said he would "
"change things. He would bring hope to this place. Nazala hears that he did "
"for a time, but now he is gone, like the dream he once carried.\n"
"\n"
"This one's target was not here, but she has found those who remember him. He "
"traveled south, alone, with a caravan of nomads trying to escape the flu. "
"Nazala follows.\n"
"\n"
"Cicatrice was once home to a small town along the road from Orcrest to "
"western Elsweyr. Nomads would stop for food and to tell stories. It was a "
"place of rest and warmth and laughter, but the Knahaten Flu destroyed all "
"that. This one has heard rumors that the inhabitants of this place followed "
"an Argonian into an oasis, hoping for help. Nazala found only a cave full of "
"poison and evidence that her quarry left on his own again.\n"
"\n"
"This time he was sick and heading north, to where the scars weep. She knows "
"where that is, but is afraid of what she will find there.\n"
"\n"
"When this one's fur was darker and her claws sharper, she heard tales of the "
"Weeping Scar. There were Khajiit who went down into the dark to feed an "
"addiction of pleasure and blood. Most came back, only to descend once more "
"into the dark. Some, however, stayed. \n"
"\n"
"Nazala's target stayed. She followed him into the dark, where her childish "
"fears manifested into those with fangs and a thirst for blood. They did not "
"attack, though things seemed strained, different. There is a feud going on "
"that this one has no interest in joining. She seeks only her target and "
"these phantoms of her youth provided.\n"
"\n"
"Infected with the flu, he came to the vampires of the Scar and hoped for "
"everlasting life. He wished to destroy one infection with another, and "
"traded the darkness of death for another type of darkness. It did not work, "
"and Nazala's target passed into the Moon's light.\n"
"\n"
"This Khajiit once terrorized a mate and her cub. The skooma and poverty "
"drove him to anger and that anger drove his mate to commit the Sacrament. "
"That cub came here to fulfill her mother's wish, but discovered that her "
"father found his own darkness. \n"
"\n"
"She says goodbye now, the Sacrament satisfied and a daughter left without a "
"need to remain. The Night Mother still softly calls and Nazala answers."

"you, I have had this pamphlet created. You know who you are. And if you "
"don't after reading this and we meet, we'll have, at the very least, words. "

"Long have the Senche-raht existed, and long have we served both ourselves "
"and others in the role of protectors and defenders. Our form, being muscular "
"and four-legged, is perfect for solo and partnered combat. When not paired "
"with a partner, we can bound forth in great leaps to claw and bite at any "
"who seek to harm us. A trained battle companion—and please mentally add an "
"emphasis on \"\"trained\"\"—can help us become an even deadlier threat on "
"the field of combat. Whether they're experienced in blade, staff, magic, or "
"bow tactics, when paired with us they gain great mobility on the field, "
"while we take advantage of any attacks they make. We watch for threats to "
"the other, making it harder to bring either of us down, as well.\n"
"\n"
"The above sounds like it would appeal to bloodthirsty individuals seeking "
"better weapons and tactics on the field. Our abilities in combat are no "
"secret.\n"
"\n"
"[Scribe's note: This one has seen Senche-raht in combat. They are a "
"ragestorm of claws and teeth. One should not wish to make enemies of such "
"beings.]\n"
"\n"
"But here's my message to those who think they can enthrall Senche-raht and "
"use them against their free will.\n"
"\n"
"Don't.\n"
"\n"
"Some have tried before. It might seem like it's working for a little bit. "
"But we find ways. Oh, do we find ways. And we have allies. Plus, if you "
"don't have our permission and our acceptance, you're just not going to get "
"the best performance out of us.\n"
"\n"
"[Scribe's note: This one notes the esteemed Senche-raht is understating the "
"above. They can be clever indeed. But this one will not reveal any of the "
"Senche-rahts' tools, of course.]\n"
"\n"
"In fact, we tell tales to our young about how to sabotage battle efforts in "
"subtle and overt ways. No, I'm not foolish enough to share those with "
"readers. They are not for you to know.\n"
"\n"
"In short, if you do not work to gain our blessing for any endeavor you would "
"have us tackle, you will ultimately fail. And you might not ever know why.\n"
"\n"
"So, don't seek to have us on your side in anything unless it is as an equal.\n"
"\n"
"Instead, talk with us. We are intelligent beings and worthy of being heard. "
"And we listen well.\n"
"\n"
"[Scribe's note: It is best to listen to Senche-raht when they choose to "
"speak, yes.]\n"
"\n"
"Now, all that aside, if you're reading this, when it comes to interacting "
"with the Senche-raht, start from the position that we are intelligent beings "
"who have our own lives and experiences. Never assume that we are simply "
"mounts or pets or creatures used to wage war. We can be friends, we have "
"family, and we can also be dreadful enemies. Start from the position that we "
"are equals, always. As with any thinking being, it will be up to individual "
"Senche-raht to take it from there. \n"
"\n"
"Most importantly, because this comes up a lot, when you see someone we're "
"partnered with who happens to be mounted and working with us? NEVER assume "
"that this person is our owner, handler, or controller. \"\"Partner\"\" is a "
"good starting point there.\n"
"\n"
"[Scribe's note: If one does not start with \"\"partner\"\" when thinking of "
"Senche-rahts, one might end up not thinking at all ever again. This one has "
"seen that outcome.]\n"
"\n"
"I hope this short pamphlet, if you've read it and truly taken in the words "
"I've shared, helps you treat all Senche-raht with respect and not as mere "
"beasts of burden or war. If it hasn't and we meet, I'll make a note of your "
"behavior and decide how best to correct it. And so will every other Senche-"
"raht.\n"
"\n"
"[Scribe's note: It is true. Senche-raht have long and accurate memories. "
"This one would rather start from that knowledge than hope that a given "
"Senche-raht does not remember things. Hope is not a given, and life is "
"already filled with too many challenges.]"

"By Investigator Vianis Orania\n"
"\n"
"Commission 37, Phase One\n"
"\n"
"Upon receiving my commission to research the whereabouts of the Forgotten "
"Mane's burial location, I had to venture forth to the Rimmen Necropolis. "
"Given what I knew of its history when compared to the little known about "
"this poor \"\"Forgotten\"\" chap, I felt no hope of finding this personage "
"buried therein. That said, one must eliminate the most likely answers before "
"starting into the more troublesome or improbable ones. I'm sure I am not the "
"first person to try there in an effort to find this rumored lost ruler, in "
"other words.\n"
"\n"
"First of all, though named for Rimmen, the necropolis itself is not IN "
"Rimmen. A puzzle, that. But, upon asking one elderly Breton about it, who "
"was seemingly soaking up all the jasmine moonshine she could find, I learned "
"an interesting tidbit: Her own studies revealed that the necropolis site "
"came about due to, of all things, a local superstition that has since fallen "
"out of favor.\n"
"\n"
"Upon providing the elder with further jasmine moonshine, she shared the "
"superstition: At that time, builders in that area who knew they'd be "
"excavating would create some sort of contraption from gold wire. They would "
"then walk around the area to be excavated, holding out the wire. If at any "
"point the wire quivered, they would note its movement and make decisions "
"about how to proceed. In this case, the builders walked quite a ways before "
"the preferred behavior occurred.\n"
"\n"
"Further application of jasmine moonshine caused my Breton source to collapse "
"into a senseless heap, so I could not find out exactly what sort of behavior "
"they looked for. I saw to it that she was returned to her rented room, then "
"headed toward my first destination.\n"
"\n"
"Now for the actual journey into the necropolis.\n"
"\n"
"I fear that I do not remember too much of it. First of all, Rimmen was "
"dealing with this pesky Euraxia situation, so none of the priests and "
"tenders I had expected to find in place at the necropolis remained. An "
"obliging Alfiq adept who crossed my path told me of their vacancy, due to "
"some action the \"\"Usurper Queen\"\" Euraxia had taken not long before I "
"entered.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, I had a commission to finish, so a lack of necropolis tenders did "
"not keep me from my duty.\n"
"What did faze me momentarily, however, was the presence of a seemingly "
"reanimated army of Darloc Brae fighting against that composed of Dremora and "
"more throughout the necropolis. I attempted, in my usual fashion, to quietly "
"move past them, but I had to employ my blades more than once before I "
"reached the tomb of the Manes.\n"
"\n"
"Where I found quiet!\n"
"\n"
"That did not last long, alas. I vaguely remember talking to someone, then I "
"woke up in a corner just outside the Manes' final resting places with a note "
"attached to my hat, flopping over my face in a most inconvenient and "
"startling fashion. Scrawled on it, in some dark substance I do not wish to "
"think about, were these words:\n"
"\n"
"Go and fulfill your commission, which is not within this necropolis. You "
"will be called when you are needed.\n"
"\n"
"Now, though I think long and hard upon that missing conversation, I cannot "
"recall it. The only thing that remains in my mind from that time in the "
"necropolis, aside from the curiosity that is the warring of two forces in "
"some sort of grudge match, is a driving urge to find the Forgotten Mane. My "
"past clients may think that I'm always driven to complete my commissions, "
"but this is different. I feel impelled. Also, I'm disturbed that I feel "
"impelled.\n"
"\n"
"A shame, that. I rather liked taking my time when seeking out pieces of "
"information. Perhaps another day I'll retrace my steps and find out what "
"happened in the Rimmen Necropolis. While I don't wish to interrupt a "
"conflict between the mighty Darloc Brae and the deadly Mehrunes Dagon, "
"perhaps a return will see that conflict ended. I think that perhaps this "
"ongoing fray is more responsible for the absent tenders than anything "
"Euraxia might have done.\n"
"\n"
"Until then, I continue my search for the Forgotten Mane. Let us hope that "
"this person actually existed and is not merely a rumor."

"Father told Shazah not to look, but she did.\n"
"\n"
"There was a cart full of dead Khajiit. One of them was Pahzbar, who snuck "
"candy for this one from the market and said her fur was very nice. Shazah "
"didn't know what to say so she ran away. She has one piece of candy left and "
"wants to put it in his paw for the burial, but Father won't let her near the "
"cart. \n"
"\n"
"This one is sorry she never got to say thank you, and she is very sad this "
"sickness is here, but Father and his friends are working hard on it. Shazah "
"will help, though she is still just learning.\n"
"\n"
"23rd of Sun's Dusk\n"
"\n"
"Father says not to be afraid, but Nien stewed vegetables for everyone "
"without anyone even asking. She even told Shazah a story last night before "
"bedtime and was kind to her. They all think Shazah can't understand, that "
"she is just a kitten, but she does. When they do odd things, it means things "
"are bad.\n"
"\n"
"The fires burning in the market smell like the time this one cast fire and "
"burned herself. And these fires have not gone out in days.\n"
"\n"
"24th of Sun's Dusk\n"
"\n"
"Father talked to one of the rich nobles this morning. They thought Shazah "
"was asleep, but she wasn't and has very keen ears. The rich noble wants the "
"district sealed off but Father says there are still sick people that need "
"help. They argued for a long time. \n"
"\n"
"25th of Sun's Dusk\n"
"\n"
"Father has moved our camp to down near the gate. The rich nobles won't let "
"us back in. The market is all burned down and people are just wandering the "
"streets. So many are sick. Earlier, one woman was screaming outside of a "
"house, pounding on the door, but they wouldn't let her in. The sun is almost "
"down, but this one can see her lying next to the steps. Edhelruin went to "
"help her but came back looking very upset. \n"
"\n"
"Lanelor and Thorelir don't look so good, either. Father has given them "
"tomorrow off. \n"
"\n"
"26th of Sun's Dusk\n"
"\n"
"Father has a cough but won't let Shazah get him any water. Edhelruin gave me "
"a few new books to study instead, but it is hard to concentrate. The air "
"smells very bad and the smoke makes this one gag. \n"
"\n"
"There is talk about an army coming. Shazah hopes it will help Father "
"distribute the medicine. \n"
"\n"
"Lanelor left this afternoon after speaking with Father. He still hasn't come "
"back and it is very late. There is a lot of screaming farther up by the rich "
"noble's gate. Shazah is getting very scared.\n"
"\n"
"27th of Sun's Dusk\n"
"\n"
"Father and Nien wrapped Thorelir in a sheet this morning. There were sores "
"and blisters all over her skin. Father's cough is worse, too. Just after "
"midday he argued with Edhelruin. Shazah heard her name mentioned.\n"
"\n"
"There are a lot of dead people in the street now. Glothor and Rallion used "
"to collect them but they have stopped. Instead, they went to ask for help "
"from the rich nobles. \n"
"\n"
"Nien didn't even try to find food for us today. All we had was some boiled "
"broth and this one is now very hungry, but she secretly gave what she had "
"left to Father. He looks very tired.\n"
"\n"
"28th of Sun's Dusk\n"
"\n"
"Nien is gone. She left sometime last night and this one misses her. She "
"would sing at night when she thought no one heard, but this one always heard."
" Now it is just Edhelruin and Father. Shazah suddenly misses her sister and "
"Mother very much. It is very lonely here. Everyone is sick and angry. "
"Someone came to the camp this afternoon and tried to steal things from "
"Father. Edhelruin had to chase them away with a knife.\n"
"\n"
"Father won't let this one see him anymore. Edhelruin says we must leave and "
"find Mother. How can Shazah leave Father like this? He is not well!\n"
"\n"
"Edhelruin is coming now. This one will demand to stay and help, even if "
"Father says her destiny is elsewhere. \n"

"This one loves her Father more than any stupid destiny."

"\n"
"The first truth: Know that Baan Dar is not about the chickens.\n"
"\n"
"Ak'an does not know why so many speak of the chickens. Yes, the Wood Elves "
"make them explode, and they call this foolishness a celebration. Wood Elves "
"also say it is wrong to eat apples, yet apples are delicious, yes? Wood "
"Elves make mead out of rotting meat and bugs. Do not listen to Wood Elves.\n"
"\n"
"The outsiders say Baan Dar is their Bandit God, their Man of a Thousand "
"Faces. Their Pariah. They do not know Baan Dar as the Khajiit know Baan Dar. "
"Wood Elves play games and tricks in Baan Dar's name, Bretons talk of sneak-"
"thieves and living legends, and bards sing of Baan Dar's exploits like he "
"was some worldly robber.\n"
"\n"
"To the outsiders, Baan Dar is a legend, a story, a joke. Baan Dar is not "
"these things. To the true Khajiit, Baan Dar is how we live. All Khajiit who "
"grasp him, from the chained souls toiling on Dres plantations to the "
"sellswords fighting for gold on the blood-stained fields of Cyrodiil, know "
"how we honor Baan Dar.\n"
"\n"
"When ja'khajiit swipes the sweetmeat off your sill to fill her starving "
"belly, she honors Baan Dar. When the slave with blood-matted hair slips her "
"chains and cuts her slaver's throat, she honors Baan Dar. When the nomad "
"gnaws off his foot to escape the trap you left to enslave him, he honors "
"Baan Dar. \n"
"\n"
"Do you leave your valuables where all can see? Baan Dar will take them. Do "
"you wait for others to break the slaver's chains? Baan Dar will slip away "
"while you mew pitifully in the darkness. Baan Dar will not free you or "
"comfort you or save you, but if you listen for him, Baan Dar will guide you "
"as you save yourself.\n"
"\n"
"Across the warm sands, beneath the warm sun, where those Khajiit not coddled "
"by wood and stone and words prowl freely with blade and bow, Baan Dar asks "
"only three things of all who follow him.\n"
"\n"
"Do not let others take it if you wish to keep it.\n"
"\n"
"Do not let others chain you if you wish to live without chains.\n"
"\n"
"Do not let others fool you if you wish not to be fooled.\n"
"\n"
"Baan Dar does not ask you to praise his name. Baan Dar does not ask you to "
"offer him tribute. Baan Dar asks only that you not be stupid, for the warm "
"sands of Elsweyr have no place for stupid Khajiit."

"Hakoshae is but a pale light compared to the radiance of Imperial City. Our "

"now covered in callouses and dirt. But still, we are safe.\n"
"\n"
"The magnate has even announced that we will be starting the Proving Festival "
"soon. For once in my life, I have no worry about dishonoring my ancestors. I "
"have traveled long and worked hard to help build Hakoshae. I am sure my "
"actions have pleased those who came before me.\n"
"\n"
"18th of Hearthfire\n"
"\n"
"The Proving Festival has begun, though it is laced with a bittersweet taste. "
"I cannot help but remember that a mere three years ago we held this same "
"celebration in our family's beautiful estate. There was feasting, dancing, "
"music and more. A thousand stories were told, a thousand songs were sung, "
"and beautiful decorations covered our home.\n"
"\n"
"The Proving Festival in Hakoshae is a far simpler affair. There are no "
"feasts, for we have little food to sustain us. There are no decorations, for "
"all of our efforts have gone to building the town we now call home. The "
"stories of grand adventures are told by tired elders, the labors of their "
"day clinging heavily to their voices.\n"

"But still, I am grateful for the magnate's decision. It is good to feel "
"Akaviri again.\n"
"\n"
"20th of Hearthfire\n"

"My sister spoke of a strange noise she heard last night. Slow, stumbling "
"steps near her window. She awoke, but was too afraid to look outside.\n"
"\n"
"I told her that there was nothing to worry about, but my heart is now heavy. "
"Everyone knows that the festival calls upon our ancestors to judge us. "
"Depending on how well we have honored them, they will send us good fortune "
"or bad luck. But to cross over to the realm of the living means that they "
"have been greatly angered. \n"
"\n"
"I only pray that my ancestors were not the ones who visited Hakoshae last "
"night. May they watch over us always, and happily remain within the "
"afterlife.\n"
"\n"
"22nd of Hearthfire\n"
"\n"
"The Proving Festival is complete, and no one has died a horrific death. I "
"now believe my sister's story to be just a dream. Foolish of me to buy into "
"her nightmares.\n"
"\n"
"The closing ceremony had a strange air, however. The magnate, a usually "
"solemn and stern man, seemed even more grim today. He spoke of the festival, "
"and how we had honored our ancestors. A common speech, one that I've heard "
"my own father recite many times.\n"
"\n"
"But then he talked about how our actions every day prove ourselves to our "
"ancestors. That we shouldn't have to beg them for attention, or prove "
"ourselves with silly tasks and meaningless riddles. That just by building "
"and maintaining Hakoshae, we have done more than enough to please those who "
"came before us.\n"
"\n"
"I am unsettled by these statements. It almost sounds as if the magnate does "
"not wish to hold the Proving Festival next year. I sincerely hope this not "
"to be the case, of course. This Hearthfire, we celebrated an important part "
"of Akaviri culture. I would hate for us to give that up, as we have already "
"given up so much."

"By Lerien Arnese, Scholar-Emeritus of Ancient Sciences\n"
"\n"
"The mysterious snake-men of Akavir brought many exotic customs to the shores "
"of Tamriel, but none so strange as their burial rites. While the most "
"bizarre traditions fell away quickly, Akaviri-descended Imperials maintained "
"most of the snake-men's more benign rituals. This description is by no means "
"exhaustive, but it should give the junior explorer some sense of what "
"challenges (both scholarly and physical) an Akaviri grave site might present."
"\n"
"\n"
"Consider the Tomb of the Serpents. Khajiiti architects originally conceived "
"of it as a mausoleum for Rimmenite royalty. But the overthrow of the Akaviri "
"Potentate in the 2E 400s, and the resulting social upheaval in Cyrodiil, "
"displaced thousands of Akaviri-descended Imperials—sending them crashing "
"over the border into Elsweyr. Ever the opportunists, the Rimmenite Khajiit "
"granted these new residents the honor of burying their honored dead in "
"Khajiiti crypts—for a price. In time, Akaviri dead vastly outnumbered those "
"of the native Khajiit, thus prompting the renaming of the structure to the "
"\"\"Tomb of the Serpents.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"By all accounts, classical Akaviri burial customs were highly regimented. "
"Snake-men ritualists bound the bodies of their dead in extravagant silken "
"wraps that covered the whole of the body, aside from the face. Upon the "
"face, they placed elaborate masks, often fashioned from silver for high-"
"ranking persons, or tin for their lesser kin. These masks typically bore the "
"ghastly aspect of a serpent, or other such monstrosity—perhaps to ward off "
"evil spirits, or more likely, superstitious grave-robbers. Most importantly, "
"funeral ritualists placed the ancestral armor of the deceased on pedestals "
"near the body. Such armor remains highly sought after. Robbers routinely "
"rifle through urns and overturn sarcophagi searching for breastplates and "
"helmets to sell to wealthy collectors. Even so, there are risks.\n"
"\n"
"Many histories speak of armor that rises to defend itself, as if worn by "
"angry spirits. While some dismiss these accounts out of hand, only a great "
"fool would pay them no heed. Remember: in the world of tomb-exploration, a "
"healthy measure of superstition will serve you well."

"By Aneshi, Keeper of Legends for the 16 Kingdoms\n"
"\n"
"Of all the Khajiiti heroes, none invokes such a sense of adventure and "
"wonder as the mighty Khunzar-ri. Like many of our myths and legends, the "
"stories associated with Khunzar-ri often contradict one another and hide "
"important truths behind allegory and allusion. Such is the case when one "
"considers the tales that describe the origin of this beloved hero. Here are "
"three of the most popular stories that tell of Khunzar-ri's first adventure. "
"Notice how different each one is. Can they all be true? Some Moon-Singers "
"believe so, though at least one revered lore master claims that the truth "
"concerning the origin of Khunzar-ri lies in the intersection of all three.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"Khunzar-ri and the Divine Moonbeam\n"
"\n"
"Before Shazeer Firstclaw became the fierce and powerful Clan Mother of the "
"Barrukit kingdom, she was a brave and curious child who got into a world of "
"trouble. Take, for example, the time she climbed to the top of Shimmering "
"Rise and suddenly found herself surrounded by a pride of hungry senche-lions."
" She was able to hold them at bay with a sharp stick and a pile of pebbles, "
"but as night fell, weariness and her own hunger began to take their toll on "
"the little cat. She called to Jone and Jode to aid her, and a Moonbeam "
"illuminated the rise. Standing in the Moonbeam was a young male Khajiit, "
"around the same age as Shazeer. \"\"Where did you come from,\"\" Shazeer "
"asked. \"\"Jone and Jode sculpted me out of Moonlight, clouds, and your own "
"courageous heart. I am Khunzar, and I am here to rescue you!\"\" And that's "
"what Khunzar did!\n"
"\n"

"Khunzar-ri and the Box at the Shrine\n"
"\n"
"One day, a lowly adept arrived at a shrine to Khenarthi to offer prayers and "
"leave alms. The adept found a small box placed prominently at the head of "
"the shrine. He moved to discard the item when a mewling emerged from inside "
"and the box shifted and rocked. There was something alive in there! The "
"adept quickly threw open the lid and saw a tiny Khajiit babe reaching toward "
"him with outstretched paws. As he lifted the babe from the box, it grew from "
"an infant to a child before it cleared the top. He set the child down and it "
"advanced to the size of a young adult. \"\"Fragrant greetings, lowly  "
"adept,\"\" the young Khajiit said with confidence and swagger. "
"\"\"Khenarthi's breath sent me to bring glory to this shrine and all the "
"land around.\"\" The adept fell to his knees and gasped, \"\"Who … who are "
"you?\"\" The Khajiit grinned, \"\"Today I am simply Khunzar, but tomorrow I "
"will be the hero, Khunzar-ri!\"\" So, never discard a box in Elsweyr without "
"first checking inside.\n"

"Alkosh was grim. Guarding time was hard work, and he was in a foul mood. "
"Mara tried to lighten his attitude, but he wanted none of her kind and "
"loving words. Next Khenarthi attempted to breathe joy into the grumpy "
"Alkosh, but he dispatched her with a roar. \"\"I suppose it is up to me,\"\" "
"said Sheggorath with an insane laugh. \"\"Do you know how much moon-sugar it "
"takes to satisfy Hircine's endless hunger?\"\" Curious, Alkosh responded, "
"\"\"I do not know the answer, insane one, so please tell me.\"\" Sheggorath "
"snapped his finger and scowled, \"\"Drats, I was hoping you could tell "
"me!\"\" Everyone was silent as a strange look came over Alkosh's face. Then, "
"all at once, he started to laugh. His laughter shook the sky and made the "
"Moons dance. He laughed for thirty days and thirty nights, until finally a "
"single tear of joy rolled down his cheek and fell upon Elsweyr. The tear "
"landed with a splash and from its depths emerged the hero Khunzar-ri, fully "
"grown and ready for adventure."

"Consulting with moon-singers has turned up contradictory information. One "

"\n"
"If you spend any time in the pristine wildernesses of the Summerset Isles, "
"you will see no shortage of flora and fauna that will take your breath away, "
"but if you are truly blessed, you may glimpse one of the most storied "
"creatures in history: the indrik. It's a privilege I've had only a handful "
"of times, as wild indriks are wary by nature and exceptionally elusive. It's "
"said that they can vanish in an instant when gazed upon by those with impure "
"intent.\n"
"\n"
"It feels trite to say that you will know an indrik when you see one, but few "
"words seem up to the task of describing the creatures. A folk tale as old as "
"the Altmer civilization tells of how Y'ffre the Singer wove indriks out of "
"the very essence of the forest, giving them the aspect of every living thing "
"found within. You might, with the briefest of glances, mistake one for a "
"common deer, but even the most casual observation will reveal indriks are so "
"much more. \n"
"\n"
"The first thing likely to catch your eye about indriks are their antlers. "
"Points of the finest crystal sprout from their crowns like the branches of "
"some great, glimmering tree. This mesmerizing sight has been the end of many "
"an ambitious hunter who thought the rack would make a fine prize. Let down "
"your guard, for even a moment, and you risk being impaled by the stately "
"lance jutting out from an indrik's forehead. There are countless legends "
"surrounding the indrik's horn: that they are an alchemical cure-all, that "
"touching one will extend your life seven-fold, even that they're made from "
"Y'ffre's tears. All I can truly tell you is that an indrik's horn is both "
"beautiful and deadly. If you believe what I've described thus far to be far-"
"fetched, I've yet to even begin.\n"
"\n"
"The body of an indrik is covered in a tapestry of fur, feathers, and fronds "
"that defy classification. One might ask themselves: are they animal, bird, "
"or plant? Can they be all of those things at once? They might not be any of "
"those things at all. Some scholars theorize that indriks are divine beings, "
"not truly of this world, closer to Aedra than mortal. One fable tells of a "
"Mer who kills an indrik, only to find its heart is pure crystal. He decides "
"to give the perfect gem to his ladylove, but she is so beguiled by its "
"splendor that her avarice taints the perfect gem, cursing it. From then on, "
"the couple's lives are filled with such sorrow that they cast themselves "
"into the sea, leaving their kin to fight over the precious gem and carry on "
"the curse. A fanciful tale, but while there is no doubt that indriks are "
"inherently magical, I've found scant evidence indicating that they are "
"literally the stuff of magic.\n"
"\n"
"I suppose I should mention that they possess four ears. For any other animal "
"that would surely stand out, but given what I've already described, I'm sure "
"you'll agree that it hardly seems noteworthy. Presumably, this trait helps "
"them appraise their surroundings and evade threats, but I'm certain there's "
"a story out there somewhere claiming one pair is for hearing in the physical "
"world and the other the spiritual. Until the indriks are studied more "
"closely, they will continue to remain creatures surrounded by myth, but I "
"can't help but feel like these creatures would be diminished by having their "
"secrets laid bare. After all, who doesn't enjoy a little mystery in the "
"world?"

"By Felarian, Jewelry Crafting Artisan\n"
"\n"
"Inside each of us is a stone: rough, rugged, unassuming. But beneath its "
"jagged surface shines a color, a gleam of possibility, unrefined but full of "
"promise. And with just a little polish, that stone has the potential to "
"become a beautiful, glittering gem.\n"
"\n"
"The art of jewelry crafting rests within us all, but not everyone has the "
"ability to see that capacity. Therefore, I've taken it upon myself to write "
"a guide to how one may begin to polish his or her skill. And through these "
"simple steps, any novice can learn the basics of jewelry crafting.\n"
"\n"
"Acquiring the Pewter Dust\n"
"\n"
"Pewter is an excellent material for any novice to begin with. Not only is it "
"easily malleable, it is also absurdly abundant. One must simply keep an eye "
"out for pewter seams within the wilderness. Much like ores, you'll generally "
"find these seams within rocky outcroppings. There, you can easily acquire "
"the needed pewter dust to begin your crafting.\n"
"\n"
"Refining the Pewter Ounces\n"
"\n"
"Next, one must refine their pewter dust into pewter ounces. You can do this "
"at any jewelry crafting station you happen upon, which can generally be "
"found within large cities. Of course, I would also recommend placing a "
"personal crafting station within your home, if possible. I've found the "
"convenience to be well worth the cost.\n"
"\n"
"Crafting the Ring\n"
"\n"
"Now is the time to put those pewter ounces to good use. While a simple "
"pewter ring may not seem the most glamorous item to craft, it is certainly "
"an excellent item to begin with. Again, a jewelry crafting station is needed "
"to complete this task.\n"
"\n"
"Deconstructing Jewelry\n"
"\n"
"A jewelry crafting station can be used to not only craft jewelry, but also "
"to deconstruct it. Deconstruction allows you to regain a portion of the "
"ingredients used to create the ring or necklace. For example, a "
"deconstructed pewter ring will give you pewter ounces. Of course, as in most "
"aspects of crafting, this will also enable you to gain experience.\n"
"\n"
"Researching Traits\n"
"\n"
"Jewelry, while beautiful in its own right, can also be extremely useful. "
"Given the right traits, your rings and necklaces can help increase health, "
"stamina, and even magicka reserves. To craft jewelry with a desired trait, "
"you must first research a piece of jewelry that already possesses that trait."
" If you find a pewter ring with the robust trait, for example, researching "
"that ring will help you create new pieces of jewelry that are also robust. "
"Sadly, this process always destroys whatever item is researched. But such is "
"progress.\n"
"\n"
"Final Word\n"
"\n"
"It is my sincere hope that this guide has inspired you to begin delving into "
"the glorious art of jewelry crafting. With just these few basics in mind, "
"anyone can start their journey to become a true artisan. And on that note, I "
"wish you the best of luck with your endeavors!"

"\n"
"I arrived at a rather watery area as I traveled through Glenumbra. It was "
"full of odd trees and murky water.  When I asked a local what this place "
"was, he said \"\"This is the Hag Fens. A swamp, as anyone with eyes can "

"always leery of those that use magic, but I am sure the swamp witches would "

"dwellings that I believe belong to the hags nearby. I have been observing "

"Hags have some strange deformity and rely on a walking staff to get around.\n"

"GRIM HARLEQUIN STYLE\n"
"By Chamberlain Haskill\n"
"\n"
"My Lord Sheogorath has directed me to compile a guide for those seeking to "
"create \"\"Grim Harlequin\"\" arms and armor, so that the Mad God's mortal "
"servants may have a way to make all their equipment look the same. Of "
"course, this standardization runs counter to all other cult practices, and "
"is insane on the face of it. (Ahem.) Milord has probably already forgotten "
"he asked me to do it, but what better do I have to do with my time than "
"write manuals for mortals? \n"
"\n"
"Actually, almost anything, now that I think about it. \n"
"\n"
"AXES\n"
"\n"
"Curved crescent axe blades are specified, with edges of varying depth, and a "
"complicated cluster of sharp, curved … somethings … at the haft. You know: "
"what-you-may-call-ems. Also, grinning skulls. Put those on everything. \n"
"\n"
"BELTS\n"
"\n"
"The belt shall be made of one, two, three, or four leather straps, of tanned "
"Human or Elf skin, where possible. A grinning skull for the buckle, of "
"course. Hip tassets may also sport skulls, wearing fool's caps and with "
"tongues extended. The extended tongue is very important—a stylistic "
"hallmark, really. \n"
"\n"
"BOOTS\n"
"\n"
"Pointed toes are required. This is not negotiable. Uppers may be of dark "
"quilted motley, as you like. But nobody will be looking past the pointed "
"toes: do that right, and the rest is gravy. Note: not actual gravy. Gravy "
"may be implied, but is never stated.   \n"
"\n"
"BOWS\n"
"\n"
"Now isn't this a pretty thing: seed pearls on the facing, and swooping "
"recurved limbs that terminate in finials curled 'round large, lovely milk "
"pearls. An instrument of death, but ornamented with nacreous excretions: "
"simply splendid. Don't you think?  \n"
"\n"
"CHEST PIECES\n"
"\n"
"Straps, straps, straps, and many layers—but not too rigid, not too "
"confining, we do not wish to make it impossible to somersault. A Grim "
"Harlequin must somersault, after all. As appropriate. (You'll know when.) "
"Also: grinning skull sternum cameo. Very important!\n"
"\n"
"DAGGERS\n"
"\n"
"What we want here is more or less a curved poniard. Pointed, of course, but "
"with a definite crescent edge, so it matches the swords and axes. The "
"serrated back edge is handy for cleaning fish or grating cheese. A bastard "
"to keep clean, though. \n"
"\n"
"GLOVES\n"
"\n"
"His Derangment has decreed that the fashion in Grim Harlequin gauntlets this "
"season shall be for half-fingered gloves—the upper half. The lower digits "
"shall remain nimble and free, so they can, as Milord Madness puts it, "
"\"\"Dance like little rabbits from blade to bow and back again.\"\" The "
"metaphor is strained, but you get the point, do you not? \n"
"\n"
"HELMETS\n"
"\n"
"Let your headgear be a cunning cowl that simultaneously evokes both a fool's "
"cap and an executioner's hood—jolly but gruesome is the goal here, mortal. "
"And there's nothing to lose by adding a mummy-wrap bandit's mask to the "
"lighter sets, or a skull visor to the heavy. \n"
"\n"
"LEG GREAVES\n"
"\n"
"These should match the boots. I suppose. Just between you and me, to be "
"quite candid, I have had no instructions from The Avuncular One in the "
"matter of greaves or schynbalds. Not a peep. It's as if he didn't care what "
"you put on your lower legs. Make of that what you will. \n"
"\n"
"\n"
"MACES\n"
"\n"
"The Grim Harlequin mace head is a grinning skull (naturally) wearing a "
"fool's cap, with a long extended tongue that wraps right 'round the top of "
"the haft. It's quite cunning, really. If I were a mortal, I'd want both the "
"one-handed and the two-handed versions. But I'm not. \n"
"\n"
"SHIELDS\n"
"\n"
"Grinning skulls, fool's-capped jester faces, diamond quilting, those curving "
"sharp what-you-may-call-em motifs: the Grim Harlequin shield has it all, "
"really. Strap this on your off-arm, and they'll get out of your way in the "
"grocery store, believe me. \n"
"\n"
"SHOULDER ARMOR\n"
"\n"
"For your left pauldron? A grinning, grimacing jester-face with an upturned "
"spade beard, of course. Oh, and another one on the right. Assuming symmetry "
"is your goal. Who knows—it might be!\n"
"\n"
"STAVES\n"
"\n"
"I already effused about the fool's-capped grinning skull on the mace head; "
"doing so again about the same motif on the finial of the Grim Harlequin "
"staff would be just rather tedious. I would prefer not to.  \n"
"\n"
"SWORDS\n"
"\n"
"The swords should be long, curved single-edged blades—almost scimitars, "
"really. The crossguard is another one of those clusters of curving "
"overlapping sharp whatevers, you'll recognize it when you see it. And there, "
"that's the Grim Harlequin guide, for what it's worth, which fortunately is "
"not up to me."

"By Lady Cinnabar of Taneth\n"
"\n"
"In Phrastus of Elinhir's spurious essay \"\"A Story of Blood: The Spinners "
"Take Tamriel,\"\" he argues, in his trademark imaginative style, that the "
"Wardens of the wilds are a militant faction of the Wood Elf priests known as "
"the Spinners. I believe this assertion is either the result of a lack of "
"proper academic rigor, or, just as likely, an attempt to manufacture "
"controversy to appeal to the masses.\n"
"\n"
"In my own meticulous research, I have certainly found some similarities "
"between the Spinners and Wardens. Like the Wood Elf priests, these guardians "
"appear to have a close connection with the god Y'ffre, the deity of song and "
"forest. \n"
"\n"
"However, in my opinion, this is where the similarities end, and just as I "
"did with the famous coven in my seminal work \"\"The Glenmoril Wyrd,\"\" I "
"shall take it upon myself to dispel the many myths and misunderstandings "
"associated with these warriors. \n"
"\n"
"First and foremost, the Spinners are not militant or violent, preferring to "
"allow others to fight for them and Valenwood, and to instead take on an "
"advisory, scholarly, or priestly role within Bosmer society. By comparison, "
"Wardens appear to be more than willing to shed blood to protect the wilds, "
"and there are many reports of them attacking individuals, gangs, and even "
"entire outposts that have done some harm to Y'ffre's realm. \n"
"\n"
"There also appear to be stark differences in the Wardens' powers from those "
"of the Spinners. While the Bosmer priests reportedly draw stories from their "
"past, present, and future to entrance their audience, Wardens seem to draw "
"upon their natural environment to change and shape reality itself. In "
"layman's terms, something I think my colleague Phrastus may appreciate, the "
"Spinners appear to employ a kind of Illusionary magic, whereas the Wardens' "
"abilities are more akin to what might traditionally be called Alteration or "
"Conjuration.\n"
"\n"
"While the Spinners are a unique priestly order that is central to Bosmer "
"culture, my studies have found no singular body or organization that "
"represents the Wardens, and indeed they appear to mostly travel alone or in "
"pairs, beholden to nobody. If they are members of any groups, it is the "
"local Fighters or Mages Guilds, or even, in one poorly documented case, a "
"member of the Dark Brotherhood.  \n"
"\n"
"Given their association with Y'ffre, are the Wardens predominantly Wood "
"Elves? It does not seem so. While Spinners are exclusively made up of "
"Bosmer, Wardens of all races—man, mer, or beast—that can be found protecting "
"Tamriel's wilds. Indeed, I have met Wardens who hailed from the northernmost "
"peaks of High Rock and from the southern forests of Elsweyr. I have even met "
"a fellow native of Hammerfell.\n"
"\n"
"And what of the Green Pact? Do the Wardens adhere to the ancient Wood Elf "
"tradition? With the exception, of course, of those who are both Warden and "
"Wood Elf, this does not appear to be the case either. In my experience, most "
"Wardens are, in fact, more than willing to make full use of nature's bounty "
"in order to survive, including partaking of both its plant and animal life. \n"
"\n"
"Finally, the Spinners are found almost exclusively within the confines of "
"Valenwood, and they rarely venture far beyond the protection of its ancient "
"forests. Wardens, however, appear all over Tamriel, with the most recent "
"reports placing some on the island of Vvardenfell. \n"
"\n"
"These are my early findings on the Wardens of Tamriel. They are a unique and "
"mysterious group, similar to the Spinners, but also distinctly different. It "
"is clear to me that greater academic inquiry is required, and I am sure upon "
"further investigation, the rest of Phrastus of Elinhir's outrageous claims "
"will be proven false (as they so often are.)"

"Spell Breaker, superficially a Dwemer tower shield, is one of the most "

"Battle of Rourken-Shalidor, the Spell Breaker protects its wielder almost "
"completely from any spell caster, either by reflecting magics or silencing "
"any mage about to cast a spell. It is said that Spell Breaker still searches "
"for its original owner, and will not remain the property of anyone else for "
"long. For most, possessing Spell Breaker for any length of time is power "
"enough.\n"
"\n"
"Staff of Hasedoki\n"
"\n"
"Hasedoki was said to have been a very competitive wizard. He wandered the "
"land in search for a wizard who was greater than he. To the best of all "
"knowledge, he never found a wizard who could meet up to his challenge. It is "
"said that he felt so lonely and isolated because so many feared his power, "
"that he bonded his life-force into his very own staff, where his soul "
"remains to this very day. Magic users all over Tamriel have been searching "
"for this magical staff. Granting its wielder a protection of magicka, it is "
"a sure prize for any magic user.\n"

"The Staff of Magnus, one of the elder artifacts of Tamriel, was a "

"mage who wields it before he becomes too powerful and upsets the mystical "
"balance it is sworn to protect.\n"
"\n"
"Umbra Sword\n"
"\n"
"The Umbra Sword was enchanted by the ancient witch Naenra Waerr, and its "
"sole purpose was the entrapment of souls. Used in conjunction with a soul "
"gem, the Sword allows the wielder the opportunity to imprison an enemy's "
"soul in the gem. Naenra was executed for her evil creation, but not before "

"The Warlock's Ring of the Archmage Syrabane is one of the most popular "

"\n"
"Ice Blade of the Monarch\n"
"\n"
"The Ice Blade of the Monarch is truly one of Tamriel's most prized artifacts."
" Legend has it that the Evil Archmage Almion Celmo enchanted the claymore of "
"a great warrior with the soul of a Frost Monarch, a stronger form of the "
"more common Frost Atronach. The warrior, Thurgnarr Assi, was to play a part "
"in the assassination of a great king in a far off land, and become the new "
"leader. The assassination failed and the Archmage was imprisoned. The Ice "
"Blade freezes all who feel its blade. The Blade circulates from owner to "
"owner, never settling in one place for long.\n"
"\n"
"Lord's Mail\n"
"\n"
"Sometimes called the Armor of Morihaus or the gift of Kynareth, this is an "

"used. It is said that whenever Kynareth deigns the wearer unworthy, the "
"Lord's Mail will be taken away and hidden for the next chosen one.\n"
"\n"
"Mace of Molag Bal\n"
"\n"
"Also known as the Vampire's Mace, the Mace of Molag Bal drains its victims "
"of magicka and gives it to the bearer. It also has the ability to transfer "
"an enemy's strength to its wielder. Molag Bal has been quite free with his "
"artifact. There are many legends about the Mace. It seems to be a favorite "
"for vanquishing wizards.\n"
"\n"
"Masque of Clavicus Vile\n"
"\n"
"Ever the vain one, Clavicus Vile made a masque suited to his own personality."
" The bearer of the Masque is more likely to get a positive response from the "
"people of Tamriel. The higher his personality, the larger the bonus. The "
"best known story of the Masque tells the tale of Avalea, a noblewoman of "
"some renown. As a young girl, she was grossly disfigured by a spiteful "
"servant. Avalea made a dark deal with Clavicus Vile and received the Masque "
"in return. Though the Masque did not change her looks, suddenly she had the "
"respect and admiration of everyone. A year and a day after her marriage to a "
"well-connected baron, Clavicus Vile reclaimed the Masque. Although pregnant "
"with his child, Avalea was banished from the Baron's household. Twenty-one "
"years and one day later, Avalea's daughter claimed her vengeance by slaying "
"the Baron.\n"
"\n"
"Mehrunes' Razor\n"
"\n"
"The Dark Brotherhood has coveted this ebony dagger for generations. This "

"The Mentor's Ring\n"

"This simple metal band is a prized possession for any apprentice to magic. "
"It lends the wearer the ability to increase their intelligence and wisdom, "

"apprentices while studying under his guidance. After Asron's death, the Ring "
"and several other possessions vanished and have since circulated throughout "
"Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of Khajiit\n"
"\n"
"The Ring of the Khajiit is an ancient relic, hundreds of years older than "
"Rajhin, the thief that made the Ring famous. It was Rajhin who used the "
"Ring's powers to make himself invisible and as quick as the breath of wind. "
"Using the Ring, he became the most successful burglar in Elsweyr's history. "
"Rajhin's eventual fate is a mystery, but according to legend, the Ring "
"rebelled against such constant use and disappeared, leaving Rajhin helpless "
"before his enemies.\n"
"\n"
"Ring of Phynaster\n"

"The Ring of Phynaster was made hundreds of years ago by a man who needed "
"good defenses to survive his adventurous life. Thanks to the Ring, Phynaster "
"lived for hundreds of years, and since then it has passed from person to "
"person. The Ring improves its wearer's overall resistance to poison, "

"The Ayleids, or Heartland High Elves, ruled Cyrodiil in the long ages of "
"Myth before the beginning of recorded history. One of the earliest recorded "
"dates, in fact, is the Fall of White-Gold Tower in 1E 243, which is commonly "
"assumed to mark the end of the Ayleids.\n"
"\n"
"Although Ayleid rule over Cyrodiil was broken in 1E 243, this was only one "
"of the most obvious stages near the end of a long decline. The first two "
"centuries of the First Era saw increasing strife between the great Ayleid "
"lords of Cyrodiil. Alessia appears to have taken advantage of a period of "
"civil war to launch her uprising. Imperial historians have traditionally "
"attributed her victory to intervention from Skyrim, but it appears she had "
"at least as much help from rebel Ayleid lords during the siege of White-Gold "
"Tower.\n"
"\n"
"The popular image of the Ayleids as brutal slavemasters is based in fact, of "
"course, but it is less well-known that a number of Ayleid princes continued "
"to rule parts of Cyrodiil after 243 as vassals of the new Empress of "
"Cyrodiil. This suggests either that Ayleid rule was not universally detested "
"or that Alessia and her successors were more pragmatic than is traditionally "
"believed (or perhaps some of both).\n"
"\n"
"In any event, excavations at a number of Ayleid sites show continued "
"occupation and even expansion during the so-called Late Ayleid Period (1E "
"243 to c. 498). At first, many Ayleid lords continued to rule as vassals of "
"the new human regime. In some cases, Ayleid supporters of Alessia were even "
"rewarded with new lands taken from slain enemies. It is not clear to what "
"extent human slavery continued under the Cyrodilic Empire. Humans continued "
"to dwell in the Ayleid-ruled areas of Cyrodiil, but there is nothing "
"definitive to show under what terms.\n"
"\n"
"This was an uneasy relationship from the beginning, and it was not destined "
"to last long. Resentment at the continued presence of Ayleid nobles within "
"the Empire was a contributing factor to the rise of the so-called Alessian "
"Order founded by Maruhk. The first victims of the Alessians were the Ayleids "
"of Cyrodiil. In the early 300s, the surviving Ayleid communities in human-"
"ruled areas were obliterated one by one. The refugees temporarily swelled "
"the power of the remaining Ayleid lordships.\n"
"\n"
"Then in 361, the Alessians gained control of the Empire and enforced the "
"Alessian Doctrines throughout its domain. The Ayleid lordships were "
"abolished. Enforcement of this decree does not appear to have required much "
"direct violence. It seems that by this point the balance of power was so "
"overwhelmingly against them and their fate so long foreshadowed that most of "
"the remaining Ayleids simply left Cyrodiil, eventually being absorbed into "
"the Elven populations of Valenwood and High Rock. Indeed, the rise of the "
"Direnni Hegemony may be linked to this exodus of Ayleids from Cyrodiil (a "
"connection so far studied very little by historians).\n"
"\n"
"Still, a remnant Ayleid population seems to have survived the rule of the "
"Alessians, because we've heard of \"\"the last king of the Ayleids\"\" "
"joining the battle of Glenumbria Moors, where the Dirennis decisively "
"defeated the Alessians in 482. How this king's people survived the preceding "
"century is unknown. We do not even know who they were, although recent "
"research points to Nenalata as the possible resting place of this \"\"last "
"king.\"\" Unfortunately, in the current state of the Empire, funds are no "
"longer available for proper scientific investigation of such extensive "
"ruins, so the answer to these questions will have to be left to future "
"generations."

"일시적으로 에일리드의 지배력이 남아있는 곳으로 몰려들었다.\n"

"On behalf of the suffering human races, St. Alessia, the first in the line "

"In token of this Covenant, Akatosh gave to Alessia and her descendants the "

"\"\"Our enemies have undone me, and spread my body into hiding. In mockery "

"\n"
"And Morihaus, confused, snorted through his ring, saying, \"\"Your crusades "

"reckless in my wit. I think I would go and gore our prisoners if you had "
"left any alive. You are blood-made-glorious, uncle, and will come again, as "
"fox animal or light. Cyrod is still ours.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Then Pelinal spoke again for the last time: \"\"Beware, Morihaus, beware! "

"Former Imperial Librarian\n"
"\n"
"After the supposed theft of an Elder Scroll from our Imperial Library, I "
"endeavored to find any sort of index or catalogue of the Scrolls in our "
"possession so that such situations may be avoided (or at least properly "
"verified) in the future. To my dismay, I discovered that the Moth Priests "
"are notoriously inexact when it comes to the actual physical manifestations "
"of the Scrolls, and had no idea how many they held, or how they were "
"organized. Merely asking the question evoked chuckles, as if a child was "
"asking why dogs cannot talk.\n"
"\n"
"I will confess, my jealousy of the ones who can read the Scrolls grows, but "
"I am not yet willing to sacrifice my sight to alleged knowledge. The older "
"Moth Priests I attempt to engage in conversation seem as batty as any other "
"elder who has lost their mind, so I fail to see what wisdom is imparted from "
"the reading.\n"
"\n"
"In any case, I set out to create my own index of the Elder Scrolls, in "
"cooperation with the monks. Day by day, we went through the tower halls, "
"with them telling me the general nature of each Elder Scroll so that I might "
"record its location. Always careful never to glimpse the writings myself, I "
"had only their word to go on. I meticulously drew out a map of the chambers, "
"where Scrolls relating to various specific prophecies were located, where "
"particular periods of history were housed. In all, it took nearly a year of "
"plodding, but at last I had rough notes on the entirety of the library to "
"begin my collation.\n"
"\n"
"It was here that things began to go amiss. In studying my notes, I found "
"many areas of overlap and outright contradiction. In some cases different "
"monks would claim the same scroll to be at opposite ends of the tower. I "
"know they have no taste for jesting, or else I would suspect I was being "
"made the fool in some game of theirs.\n"
"\n"
"I spoke to one of the older monks to relate my concerns, and he hung his "
"head in sorrow for my wasted time. \"\"Did I not tell you,\"\" he coughed, "
"\"\"when you started this that all efforts would be futile? The Scrolls do "
"not exist in countable form.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I had thought you meant there were too many to be counted.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"There are, but that is not the least of their complexities. Turn to the "
"repository behind you, and tell me how many Scrolls are locked therein.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I ran my fingers over the metal casings, tallying each rounded edge that "
"they encountered. I turned back. \"\"Fourteen,\"\" I said.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Hand me the eighth one,\"\" he said, reaching out his hand.\n"
"\n"
"I guided the cylinder into his palm, and he gave a slight nod to acknowledge "
"it. \"\"Now, count again.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Humoring him, I again passed my hands over the Scrolls, but could not "
"believe what I was feeling.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Now … now there are eighteen!\"\" I gasped.\n"
"\n"
"The old monk chuckled, his cheeks pushing up his blindfold until it folded "
"over itself. \"\"And in fact,\"\" he said, \"\"there always were.\"\"\n"

"There are many legendary gladiators who've made their names in the Blessed "
"Crucible. Among them, Felhorn, Sanarel the Great, and Aleris the Shroud are "
"known for their formidable combat prowess and fighting spirit. But others, "
"like Josef the Intolerant, have become famous for other reasons.\n"
"\n"
"Let me first say that the Blessed Crucible of Skyrim features an amazing "
"array of competitors, with combatants arriving from all over Tamriel to test "
"their mettle. In this time of warring alliances, it's not just anywhere that "
"an Altmer would drag a wounded Orc to safety, or where a Redguard would so "
"readily step into an arrow's path for an Argonian, but the Blessed Crucible "
"is one such place. In the Crucible, one's team is one's nation, and the "
"struggle for the Brimstone Crown the national religion.\n"
"\n"
"However, there was one man, a young gladiator named Josef. He came from the "
"Breton Lion Guard, and was fresh-faced, decent with a blade. None questioned "
"that he was a healthy boy, ready to take the Crucible by storm. But Josef "
"could never understand the social phenomenon of the Crucible, and trusted "
"only other Bretons. He could not fathom the fact that gladiators must place "
"their trust in their teams, not in gladiators of the same race.\n"
"\n"
"Said gladiator Oberelle, \"\"Our match began, and this Breton boy sent his "
"Khajiiti team member sprawling to the ground. Then he looked me in the eye "
"and blinked twice, slowly. 'Is he trying to wink?' whispered my ally, "
"Doumant. We capitalized on their folly and beat the boy and the Khajiit "
"unconscious. One must never refuse such strokes of fortune in the Blessed "
"Crucible.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"As time passed, young Josef grew increasingly frustrated. He scoffed at "
"suggestions to collaborate with gladiators of other races. His demeanor "
"incensed the Crucible audience along with its competitors, and management "
"loved him for it. \"\"We would print Josef's face on currency if we could. "
"He is a boon to us,\"\" they said.\n"
"\n"
"The gladiators felt differently.\n"
"\n"
"Said Dalu the Dunmeri Blade, \"\"Josef told me he would never collaborate "
"with a kwama farmer. And he hounded me every day for kwama eggs. He was "
"certain that I had some, or could, by some miracle, produce them. I have "
"never even tasted a kwama egg. I was born in Skyrim.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Said Ethenen, the Rabid Dunmer, \"\"Josef repeatedly referred to me as Dalu."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Said Azrukana, the Crimson Cat, \"\"I told him he could trust me in battle. "
"That he needed to, if he wanted to live for much longer as a gladiator. He "
"rasped his voice and said, 'This one thinks you should have some moon-sugar "
"and keep your opinions to yourself.' I did not like that.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Said Inarfar, the Skyforged Razor, \"\"When Hrasvard, my comrade of a "
"decade, was slain in combat, I went to the Hall of Champions and I wept. "
"That Breton boy found me and said, 'Did you run out of mead-coin? I know how "
"that feels, but unlike you Nords, I wouldn't cry about it.' The beating that "
"ensued in Hrasvard's honor lasted eight minutes.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"No gladiator had gained as much infamy as Josef in so short a time, but he "
"soon disappeared.\n"

"Building a fort in a swamp is no trivial task, but my men and I have "
"accomplished it with Arx Corinium. It was a battle the entire duration—with "
"insect-borne disease, with the wildlife of the marshlands, but the Empire "
"wanted a foothold in this region and we provided one.\n"
"\n"
"Unfortunately, as of this writing, we've packed our arms and armor on orders "
"from Colonel Marianus, and prepare to leave our work behind. The Colonel "
"cites the continued loss of a half-dozen soldiers every month in maintaining "
"Arx Corinium as \"\"detrimental to the war effort.\"\" I agree, and would "
"note that I predicted this outcome when we arrived over a year and a half "
"ago. I said as much to the Colonel, who ordered that the project proceed. "
"This isn't a statement of complaint, but of fact.\n"
"\n"
"Construction suffered numerous complications: the bog impeded our progress "
"at every turn, and it became clear the initial foundation we built would "
"sink after the first month. When we moved our location farther to the north, "
"we met a fierce wamasu that cost me ten men to chase off the premises. After "
"repeated encounters, our war wizard, Belisaro, named it Ganakton the "
"Tempest, after the bolts of lightning that the beast emits from every "
"orifice (\"\"Ganakton\"\" was the moniker of a hated aunt, rumored to "
"possess Orcish blood).\n"
"\n"
"The dense humidity was another foe, turning our plate armor to steel barrels "
"full of sweat during the early months of construction. It goes against "
"regulation, but I allowed my soldiers the luxury of cloth armor during the "
"summer. It was that or death from heatstroke. We would have been at a "
"disadvantage had we come under attack, but any enemy marching towards Arx "
"Corinium would be half-dead by the time they reached us. In any event, it "
"never happened.\n"
"\n"
"Battle found us just the same: every beast in this swamp, large or small, is "
"a walking death trap, and some days, we fought sword to stinger with insects "
"the size of a grown man's head. Other days, our mages contended with the "
"likes of Ganakton the Tempest, who continued to terrorize the fort. He razed "
"the eastern wall a dozen times, and I regret that I will never be allowed "
"the luxury of mounting his skull on my mantle. But if it means we finally "
"get to leave, I'll gladly allow Ganakton his life.\n"
"\n"
"As I look back on this last year and a half, at the resources and manpower "
"it took to construct Arx Corinium, I can't say it's been worth it. Again, "
"this isn't a statement of grievance. I bear my superiors no ill will for my "
"orders. However, I would note that I made several warnings in advance of "
"this project, and have compiled copies of my letters to my immediate "
"superior, Colonel Marianus, detailing the reasons why I believed the "
"construction of Arx Corinium could prove a disastrous venture for the Empire."
"\n"
"\n"
"I want to clarify that this is not a declaration of failure on anyone's "
"part, either for myself, my men, or Colonel Marianus. I am fully aware that "
"that decision falls to Tribune Hilario, whom I encourage to read the letters "
"I mention above. I've already sent word and made them available for any "

"Kynbriefing for the Lightless Oubliette\n"
"\n"
"If you've never served a shift in the Lightless Oubliette before, pay close "
"attention, because this is not a place where you want to make a mistake. The "
"L. O. was specifically constructed as a detention facility for captive "
"servants of the Shining Bitch, and you know how our Dread Lord feels about "
"her. If any of these Aurorans or Lustrants escape on your watch, you'll be "
"lucky to get off with Second-Degree Gradual Discorporation.\n"
"\n"
"Now I don't care how well you know the Seven-Hundred-and-One Edicts; I don't "
"care if you can quote chapter and verse from the Mandatory Codicils: the "
"rules that matter in the Lightless Oubliette are the following. \n"
"\n"
"1.	No white or yellow glow crystals to be brought into the facility.\n"
"\n"
"This isn't because we like the place gloomy, fools. It's because the "
"Prisoners can pervert certain spectra of light into working on their behalf. "
"Stick to blue glow crystals for illumination, or even better, open flame. \n"
"\n"
"2.	No torment-sport with the Prisoners.\n"
"\n"
"That includes the Elf King. No, I don't know why, that's just the way it is. "
"Rumor has it the Dread Lord is planning some kind of nasty surprise for the "
"Shining Bitch, and to pull it off he needs her servants with their bodies "
"intact. Could be true, I don't know. \n"
"\n"
"3.	Clean up after yourself. \n"
"\n"
"This is a top-security facility, so no Soul Shriven are allowed in, not even "
"custodians. You make a mess, you clean it up. This includes any bodily "
"fluids spilled during sparring practice—if I find stains on the flagstones "
"again, somebody's next shift will be in the scathe-rings."

"2. 죄수들을 고문하지 말 것.\n"

"고약한 깜짝 선물을 준비하고 계시고, 그년을 섬기는 온전한 하인이 필요하다더군. 진짜인지는 나도 모른다.\n"

"3. 있었던 곳은 자기가 치울 것.\n"
"\n"
"이곳은 최고 등급 보안 시설이고, 따라서 소울 쉬리븐은 청소부일지라도 들어올 수 없다. 네가 어질러 놓은 것은 네가 치워라. 이건 대련 "
