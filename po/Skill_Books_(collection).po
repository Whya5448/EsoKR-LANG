"Third Edition\n"
"\n"
"By the Council of Healers, Imperial University\n"
"\n"
"After much analysis of living specimens, the Council long ago determined "
"that all \"\"races\"\" of Elves and Humans may mate with each other and bear "
"fertile offspring. Generally the offspring bear the racial traits of the "
"mother, though some traces of the father's race may also be present. It is "
"less clear whether the Argonians and Khajiit are interfertile with both "
"Humans and Elves. Though there have been many reports throughout the Eras of "
"children from these unions, as well as stories of unions with Daedra, there "
"have been no well documented offspring. Khajiit differ from Humans and Elves "
"in not only their skeletal and dermal physiology—the \"\"fur\"\" that covers "
"their bodies—but their metabolism and digestion as well. Argonians, like the "
"dreugh, appear to be a semi-aquatic troglophile form of humans, though it is "
"by no means clear whether the Argonians should be classified with dreugh, "
"men, mer, or (in this author's opinion), certain tree-dwelling lizards in "
"Black Marsh.\n"
"\n"
"The reproductive biology of Orcs is at present not well understood, and the "
"same is true of Goblins, trolls, harpies, dreugh, Tsaesci, Imga, various "
"Daedra and many others. Certainly, there have been cases of intercourse "
"between these \"\"races,\"\" generally in the nature of rape or magical "
"seduction, but there have been no documented cases of pregnancy. Still, the "
"interfertility of these creatures and the civilized hominids has yet to be "
"empirically established or refuted, likely due to the deep cultural "
"differences. Surely any normal Bosmer or Breton impregnated by an Orc would "
"keep that shame to herself, and there's no reason to suppose that an Orc "
"maiden impregnated by a human would not be likewise ostracized by her "
"society. Regrettably, our oaths as healers keep us from forcing a coupling "
"to satisfy our scientific knowledge. We do know, however, that the Sload of "
"Thras are hermaphrodites in their youth and later reabsorb their "
"reproductive organs once they are old enough to move about on land. It can "
"be safely assumed that they are not interfertile with men or mer.\n"
"\n"
"One might further wonder whether the proper classification of these same "
"\"\"races,\"\" to use the imprecise but useful term, should be made from the "
"assumption of a common heritage and the differences between them have arisen "
"from magical experimentation, the manipulations of the so-called \"\"Earth "
"Bones,\"\" or from gradual changes from one generation to the next."

"살아 있는 상태의 표본을 여러 번 분석한 결과, 위원회는 오래 전 엘프와 인간이 서로 짝을 짓고 종족번식이 가능한 자손을 출산할 수 "
"있다고 판단하였다. 이러한 교차생식의 경우, 아버지 쪽의 종족적 특성에 대한 잔재가 남긴 하겠지만, 일반적으로 자손은 어머니 쪽의 종족적 "
"특성을 물려받게 된다. 다만, 아고니언과 카짓 종족이 인간과 엘프 모두에 대해 교차 생식이 가능한 지는 아직 확실히 밝혀진 바가 없다. "
"이러한 종류의 교차 생식이나, 심지어 데이드라와의 교차 생식에 관해서도 과거부터 많은 이야기가 있어왔지만, 그 가능성을 증명할 수 있는 "
"자손은 현재로서는 존재하지 않는다. 카짓 종족은 골격적 구조뿐만 아니라 \\\\\"\\\\\"모피\\\\\"\\\\\"와 같은 생리적인 "
"부분뿐만 아니라, 물질대사과정이나 소화과정까지 달라 쉽게 추측할 수 조차 없다. 아고니언 종족은 드레그족처럼 인간의 반수생 동굴 생명체의 "
"형태로 추측되지만, 이 사실이 아고니언들을 드레그, 인간, 머, 혹은(저자의 의견으로는) 블랙 마쉬에 서식하는 도마뱀들과 같은 부류로 "
"생각해야 하는지도 명확하게 밝혀지지 않았다.\n"

"오크족의 생식, 생리에 관해서는 현재 명확히 밝혀진 바가 없다. 또, 고블린, 트롤, 하피, 드레그, 쎄이치, 임가, 그리고 데이드라와 "
"그 외의 많은 종족들 역시 마찬가지이다. 확실히, 이러한 '종족들' 간의 성적 교합이, 강간 혹은 마법적 유혹에 의하여 발생한 경우는 "
"여럿 있었다. 하지만, 이것이 번식으로 이어질 수 있는 가에 대한 신뢰할만한 기록들은 존재하지 않는다. 여전히 이러한 생물들과 문명화된 "
"인류 사이의 성적교합은 커다란 문화적 차이로 인하여 경험적으로만 인정되거나, 터부시당하기 때문이다. 확실히, 오크에 의하여 자손을 가지게 "
"된 보스머들이나 브레튼은 그 사실을 부끄러워하며 숨기려 할 것이고, 인간에 의해 자손을 가지게 된 오크 여성의 경우에도 역시 마찬가지로, "
"그녀가 속한 집단에서 배척당하리라는 것은 의심할 여지가 없다. 유감스럽게도, 우리는 치유사로서의 서약에 의하여, 과학적 호기심을 "
"만족시키기 위해 강제로 그들이 자손을 가지게 하는 행위는 할 수 없다. 하지만, 우리는 쓰라스 지역의 슬로드 종족이 유년기에는 "
"자웅동체이지만, 이후 성장해 육지를 돌아다닐 수 있게 되면 그들이 생식기를 재흡수 한다는 것을 알고 있으며, 이러한 예로 미루어 볼 때, "
"그것들이 인간이나 머들과는 자손을 만들어 낼 수 없을 것이라는 추정은 아마 틀리지 않을 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"어쩌면, 혹자는 한발 더 나아가 유용하지만 부정확한 분류기준인 '종족들' 이라는 용어의 유래를 궁금해 할지도 모른다. 그것이 공통적 "
"유산이나 소위 \\\\\"\\\\\"어스 본\\\\\"\\\\\"이라고 불리는 마법적 실험에 의해 유발되어진 다른 종족간의 차이점으로 "
"추정되어 만들어졌는지, 아니면 한 세대에서 다음 세대로 넘어갈 때 천천히 나타나는 변화에 의해서 만들어 졌는지에 대하여 말이다."

"\n"
"As the curtain rises, we see the misty labyrinthian landscape of the "
"legendary Elden Grove of Valenwood. All around we hear wolves howling. A "
"bloodied reptilian figure, SCHIAVAS, breaks through the branches of one of "
"the trees and surveys the area.\n"
"\n"
"SCHIAVAS: It's clear.\n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH, a beautiful Dark Elf mage, climbs down from the tree, helped by "
"the barbarian. There is the sound of footsteps nearby. Schiavas readies his "
"sword and Inzoliah prepares to cast a spell. Nothing comes out.\n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH: You're bleeding. You should have Dolcettus heal that for you.\n"
"\n"
"SCHIAVAS: He's still drained from all the spells he had to cast down in the "
"caves. I'm fine. If we get out of this and no one needs it more, I'll take "
"the last potion of healing. Where's Malvasian?\n"
"\n"
"MALVASIAN, a High Elf battlemage, and DOLCETTUS, a Cyrodiil healer, emerge "
"from the tree, carrying a heavy chest between the two of them. They "
"awkwardly try to get down from the tree, carrying their loot.\n"
"\n"
"MALVASIAN: Here I am, though why I'm carrying the heavy load is beyond me. I "
"always thought that the advantage of dungeon delving with a great barbarian "
"was that he carried all the loot.\n"
"\n"
"SCHIAVAS: If I carried that, my hands would be too full to fight. And tell "
"me if I'm wrong, but not one of the three of you has enough magicka reserved "
"to make it out of here alive. Not after you electrified and blasted all "
"those homunculuses down below ground.\n"
"\n"
"DOLCETTUS: Homunculi.\n"
"\n"
"SCHIAVAS: Don't worry, I'm not going to do what you think I'm going to do.\n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH (innocently): What's that?\n"
"\n"
"SCHIAVAS: Kill you all and take the Ebony Mail for myself. Admit it—you "
"thought I had that in mind.\n"
"\n"
"DOLCETTUS: What a perfectly horrible thought. I never thought anyone, no "
"matter how vile and degenerate— \n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH: Why not?\n"
"\n"
"MALVASIAN: He needs porters, like he said. He can't carry the chest and "
"fight off the inhabitants of Elden Grove both.\n"
"\n"
"DOLCETTUS: By Stendarr, of all the mean, conniving, typically Argonian— \n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH: And why do you need me alive?\n"
"\n"
"SCHIAVAS: I don't necessarily. Except that you're prettier than the other "
"two, for a smoothskin that is. And if something comes after us, it might go "
"for you first.\n"
"\n"
"There is a noise in some bushes nearby.\n"
"\n"
"SCHIAVAS: Go check that out.\n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH: It's probably a wolf. These woods are filled with them. You check "
"it out.\n"
"\n"
"SCHIAVAS: You have a choice, Inzoliah. Go and you might live. Stay here and "
"you definitely won't.\n"
"\n"
"Inzoliah considers and then goes to the bushes.\n"
"\n"
"SCHIAVAS (to Malvasian and Dolcettus): The king of Silvenar will pay good "
"money for the Mail, and we can divide it more nicely between three than four."
"\n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH: You're so right.\n"
"\n"
"Inzoliah suddenly levitates up to the top of the stage. A semi-transparent "
"Ghost appears from the bush and rushes at the next person, who happens to be "
"Schiavas. As the barbarian screams and thrashes at it with his sword, it "
"levels blasts of whirling gas at him. He crumbles to the ground. It turns "
"next to Dolcettus, the healer, and as the Ghost focuses its feasting chill "
"on the hapless Dolcettus, Malvasian casts a ball of flame at it that causes "
"it to vaporize into the misty air.\n"
"\n"
"Inzoliah floats back down to the ground as Malvasian examines the bodies of "
"Dolcettus and Schiavas, who are both white-faced from the draining power of "
"the ghost.\n"
"\n"
"MALVASIAN: You had some magicka reserved after all.\n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH: So did you. Are they dead?\n"
"\n"
"Malvasian takes the potion of healing from Dolcettus's pack.\n"
"\n"
"MALVASIAN: Yes. Fortunately, the potion of healing wasn't broken when he "
"fell. Well, I guess this leaves just the two of us to collect the reward.\n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH: We can't get out of this place without each other. Like it or not.\n"
"\n"
"The two battlemages pick up the chest and begin plodding carefully through "
"the undergrowth, pausing from time to time at the sound of footsteps or "
"other eerie noises.\n"
"\n"
"MALVASIAN: Let me make sure I understand. You have a little bit of magicka "
"left, so you elected to use it to make Schiavas the ghost's target, forcing "
"me to use most of my limited reserve to destroy the creature so I wouldn't "
"be more powerful than you. That's first-rate thinking.\n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH: Thank you. It's only logical. Do you have enough power to cast any "
"other spells?\n"
"\n"
"MALVASIAN: Naturally. An experienced battlemage always knows a few minor but "
"highly effective spells for just such a trial. I take it you, too, have a "
"few tricks up your sleeve?\n"
"\n"
"INZOLIAH: Of course, like you said.\n"
"\n"
"They pause for a moment before continuing as a fearful wail pierces the air. "
"When it dies away, they slowly trudge on."

"Incorporating Fragment One\n"
"\n"
"Translated and With Commentary by Florin Jaliil\n"
"\n"
"Introduction:\n"
"\n"
"Writing the biography of anyone is a challenge. Usually the problem lies in "
"assessing one's sources, comparing the prejudices of one chronicle versus "
"another versus another. There is but one record of the man called Topal the "
"Pilot, the earliest known Aldmeri explorer of Tamriel. Only four short verse "
"fragments of the epic \"\"Father of the Niben\"\" have survived to present "
"day, but they offer an interesting if controversial look at the Middle "
"Merethic Era when Topal the Pilot may have sailed the seas around Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"Though \"\"Father of the Niben\"\" is the only written record of Topal the "
"Pilot's voyages, it is not the only proof of his existence. Among the "
"treasures of the great Crystal Tower of Summerset Isle are his crude but "
"fascinating maps, his legacy to all Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"The translation of the Aldmeri Udhendra Nibenu, \"\"Father of the Niben,\"\" "
"is my own, and I accept that other scholars may disagree with some of my "
"choice of words. I cannot promise my translation lives up to the beauty of "
"the original: I have only strived for simple coherence.\n"
"\n"
"Fragment One:\n"
"\n"
"Second ship, the Pasquiniel, manned by pilot\n"
"Illio, was to follow the southern pointing\n"
"Waystone; and the third, the Niben, manned\n"
"By pilot Topal, was to follow the north-east\n"
"Pointing waystone; the orders from the\n"
"Crystal Tower, they were to sail forth for\n"
"Eighty moons and then return to tell.\n"
"Only Niben returned to Firsthold, laden high with\n"
"Gold and spice and fur and strange creatures,\n"
"Dead and live.\n"
"Though, alas, Old Ehlnofey Topal never found, he\n"
"Told the tales of the lands he had visited to the\n"
"Wonderment of all.\n"
"For sixty-six days and nights, he sailed, over crashing\n"
"Waves of dire intent, past whirlpools, through\n"
"Mist that burned like fire, until he reached the\n"
"Mouth of a great bay and he landed on a\n"
"Sun-kissed meadow of gentle dells.\n"
"As he and his men rested, there came a fearsome howl,\n"
"And hideous Orcs streamed forth from the murky\n"
"Glen, cannibal teeth clotted with gore\n"
"\n"
"For centuries, strange crystalline balls were unearthed at the sites of "
"ancient Aldmeri shipwrecks and docks, peculiar artifacts of the Merethic and "
"Dawn Eras that puzzled archeologists until it was demonstrated that each had "
"a tendency to rotate on its axis in a specific direction. There were three "
"varieties, one that pointed southward, one that pointed northeast, and one "
"that point northwest. It is not understood how they work, but they seemed "
"attuned to particular lines of power. These are the \"\"waystones\"\" of the "
"fragment, which each of the pilots used to point their craft in the "
"direction they were assigned to go. A ship with a name not mentioned in the "
"fragment took his vessel northwest, towards Thras and Yokuda. The Pasquiniel "
"took the southern waystone, and must have sailed down toward Pyandonea. "
"Topal and his northeast waystone found the mainland of Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"It is clear from this fragment what the three ships were assigned to do—find "
"a passage back to Old Ehlnofey so that the Aldmer now living in Summerset "
"could learn what became of their old homeland. As this book is intended to "
"be a study of Topal the Pilot, there is scarcely room to dedicate to "
"different theories of the Aldmeri exodus from Old Ehlnofey. If I were using "
"this poem as my only source, I would have to agree with the scholars who "
"believe in the tradition that several ships left Old Ehlnofey and were "
"caught in a storm. Those who survived found their way to Summerset Isle, but "
"without their waystones, they did not know what direction their homeland was."
" After all, what other explanation is there for three ships heading in three "
"opposite directions to find a place?\n"
"\n"
"Naturally, only one of the ships returned, and we do not know if either or "
"both of the other two found Old Ehlnofey or perished at sea or at the hands "
"of the ancient Pyandoneans, Sload, or Yokudans. We must assume, unless we "
"think the Aldmer particularly idiotic, that at least one of them must have "
"been pointing in the right direction. It may well have even been Topal, and "
"he simply did not go northeast far enough.\n"
"\n"
"So, Topal setting sail from Firsthold heads northeast, which coincidentally "
"is the longest one can travel along the Abecean Sea without striking land of "
"any kind. Had he traveled straight east, he would have struck the mainland "
"somewhere in what is now the Colovian West of Cyrodiil in a few weeks. Had "
"he traveled southeast, he might have reached the hump of Valenwood in a few "
"days. Our pilot, judging by his own and our modern maps, sailed in a "
"straight line northeast, through the Abecean Sea, and into the Iliac Bay, "
"before touching ground somewhere near present-day Reich Gradkeep in two "
"months' time.\n"
"\n"
"The rolling verdant hills of southern High Rock are unmistakable in this "
"verse, recognizable to anyone who has been there. The question, of course, "
"is what is to be made of this apparent reference to Orcs occupying the "
"region? Tradition has it that the Orcs were not born until after the Aldmer "
"had settled the mainland, that they sprung up as a distinct race following "
"the famous battle between Trinimac and Boethiah at the time of Resdayn."

"The Redguards' reputation as peerless sword-wielders is well earned. But "
"after spending some time in the stifling heat of the Alik'r, I can tell you "
"that they skillfully cut more than just dunerippers and grave robbers. I'm "
"speaking, of course, about precious stones!\n"
"\n"
"During my most recent visit to Sentinel, I had the opportunity to speak with "
"a clever jeweler-historian named Berzhalan. According to him, the hills of "
"Yokuda (the Redguards' long-lost home), were filled with nests of volcanic "
"geodes and jewels. The ancient Yokudans mined up topaz, sapphires, "
"amethysts, and opals—placing great value on any stone with rich color or "
"creamy luster. (Diamonds, shockingly enough, were often discarded due to "
"their lack of hue!)\n"
"\n"
"In addition to creating wide necklaces and heavy bangles, the Yokudans used "
"these gems to adorn their most prized possessions: family swords. They  "
"studded the pommels, scabbards, crossguards (and even the blades!) with "
"finely-cut jewels. Over time, this practice fell out of favor. The near-"
"constant civil wars of the Yokeda forced the Redguards, more often than not, "
"to choose utility over beauty. Nonetheless, the gem-cutting tradition "
"remained strong. Yokudan jewelers turned their focus from the martial to the "
"glamorous, crafting elaborate opal headdresses, jangling sapphire anklets, "
"and wide amethyst rings. When the time came for the Ra Gada invasions, these "
"craftsmen brought their skills and traditions to Tamriel. I was surprised to "
"learn that the tools and methods of Redguard jewelers have remained largely "
"unchanged ever since.\n"
"\n"
"So if you ever make your way to Alik'r, do yourself a favor and buy a "
"jeweled Redguard knife or a Totambu-style ring. True, you'll never have the "
"opportunity to see the rolling hills of Yokuda. But these treasures can take "

"It's not like jewelry isn't important to us Wood Elves, truly. There are few "
"things more appreciated than carving the bones of a fallen enemy for your "
"sweetheart back home. That, alongside a well cooked hunk of haunch, and you "
"have yourself a romantic little setup right there.\n"
"\n"
"But, like most things, the High Elves take jewelry crafting to an entirely "
"new level. They don't see it as a simple career choice. By Y'ffre, they "
"don't even consider it a mere passion. No, it is fate, a calling handed down "
"to them. Feel free to ask one if you want to hear all about it. They would "
"be happy to talk your ear off. Trust me.\n"
"\n"
"From what I can understand, the High Elf art of jewelry crafting is "
"generally passed down through generations. And that really does mean "
"something to the High Elves. Taking on the legacy of their family name is "
"not only expected, it's revered. In that way though, all of them respect "
"each other. Even a kinlord will speak highly of a family of fishers, so long "
"as they do their job right. You can't really say that about the rest of "
"Tamriel.\n"
"\n"
"And I have to admit, their jewelry is beautiful. You ain't never seen such "
"well-crafted rings as those on even a common High Elf's fingers. They're "
"downright dainty, intricate, even. Swirls and patterns that seem to "
"intertwine, even on the tiniest scale. There's a kind of complex simplicity "
"there. Wait, does that even make sense?\n"
"\n"
"I mean to say, jewelry made by the High Elves just seems natural. Like the "
"branches of a tree, or the swirls within a running stream. I don't know how "
"they do it. I suppose that's the trade off of having your skills passed down "
"through such long family lines. These High Elves aren't simply honing their "
"skill throughout a lifetime, no. They're honing a skill throughout "
"generations.\n"
"\n"
"I'd love to learn a thing or two while I'm visiting Summerset, but I doubt "
"that will ever happen. Not because I haven't been able to find someone who "
"is willing to talk with me about their craft, oh no. I just haven't found "
"one who won't drone on and on for hours on some technique their great-great-"
"grand uncle came up with hundreds of years ago.\n"
"\n"
"That being said, I have yet to have a single mer here ask me about my own "
"techniques. Of course, that's not too surprising. After all, I'm just a "
"muddy little Wood Elf carving up some bone."

"\n"
"Anyone with ore and a hammer can fashion a crude weapon at an anvil, yes, "
"but it takes more than a burly arm to grasp the subtleties of the art. Some "
"of my fellow Altmer may sneer at weapon forging, considering it work fit "
"only for commoners, but in doing so they only expose their own pitiable "
"ignorance. Unraveling the mysteries of form, function, and the effects of "
"various materials on the substance of the weapon is an undertaking that "
"requires not only a sharp mind, but strength of body and patience through "
"hours of practice each day.\n"
"\n"
"To become a master and create peerless weapons, much time must be spent in "
"research, slowly uncovering new secrets which, in turn, lead to more "
"revelations. One must study weapons from every culture crafted by many "
"smiths, deconstructing them and analyzing the results methodically to "
"identify the source of unusual properties. The weapon's shape, its component "
"materials, and its balance are just a few of the elements that must be "
"scrutinized.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, we cannot ignore the many types of weapon. Each one, from sword "
"to axe to hammer, one- or two-handed, is its own realm of study. It is "
"entirely up to the smith whether to pursue exhaustive knowledge of one type "
"or to study a wider variety, but the end goal should be the same for all who "
"demand perfection: to attain a comprehensive understanding of all weapon "
"traits and how to impart them to any creation.\n"
"\n"
"As you can see, producing weapons goes far beyond making a stick of metal to "
"hit enemies with. The complexities of the craft run as deep as any magical "
"study, and only through time, research, and practice can one truly claim to "
"be an expert.\n"
"\n"
"There are those who will try to convince you the work of a smith is crude or "
"artless; in such encounters, simply smile back, knowing that you are on a "
"worthy path. By putting in the requisite effort to elevate your creations "
"through the relentless pursuit of knowledge, your work will be remembered in "

"Glyphs! Glyphs for enchanting! Everyone knows how to make them—you need "

"Often overlooked by aspiring mages, Alchemy is a time-honored, rewarding "
"discipline that can change the lives of those who master it. It is "
"difficult, and often dangerous, to advance one's knowledge of the materials "
"used in alchemical formulas, but continued study and hard work will, in the "
"end, reward the alchemist greatly.\n"
"\n"
"Before success can be achieved, or even attempted, the beginning alchemist "
"must understand the basic principles behind his craft. Many items in our "
"world, mostly organic in nature, can be broken down into more fundamental "
"essences with magical properties. The more skilled the Alchemist, the more "
"the properties of an ingredient that can be harnessed. Combining the "
"essences of two or more ingredients can result in the creation of a potion, "
"which anyone may then drink. (Legend has it that a truly great Alchemist can "
"brew potions from a single ingredient, a feat well beyond the capabilities "
"of most.)\n"
"\n"
"The Alchemist's potion can have several effects, depending on the "
"ingredients used, and not all effects are beneficial. In many cases, recipes "
"result in a potion with a mix of positive and negative effects; it is up to "
"the Alchemist to determine which recipes yield the best results. (It is "
"worth noting that potions can be created to have only negative effects and "
"be used as poisons. This practice is not recommended by the author, and this "
"text shall not discuss such potions further.)\n"
"\n"
"Wortcraft\n"
"\n"
"Wortcraft is, in fact, amateur Alchemy. Eating an ingredient requires "
"grinding it against the teeth, which occasionally releases its simplest "
"essence and results in a fleeting effect on the eater. Wortcraft never has "
"as strong a result as a potion created using the proper tools.\n"
"\n"
"An Alchemist's Tools\n"
"\n"
"The mortar and pestle is the Alchemist's most important and essential tool. "
"Without it, no ingredient can be correctly prepared for use in a potion. The "
"budding alchemist is advised to keep a mortar and pestle on hand at all "
"times, and become comfortable with its use early on. The simple grinding of "
"an ingredient is the most fundamental step in brewing potions. When properly "
"ground, the petals of the Redwort flower yield a powder that can, when mixed "
"correctly with another ingredient such as ginseng, create a potion to cure "
"poisons. (This is one formula that many alchemists are quick to learn and "
"retain, as mistakes in potion mixing often require its use.)\n"
"\n"
"The advanced Alchemist has other tools at his disposal to improve the "
"quality of his potions. A retort can be employed to purify the mixture, "
"improving the positive effects of a potion. Washing the mixture through an "
"alembic helps to distill the potion, reducing any negative effects, and a "
"calcinator can be used to burn away impurities in the mixture, increasing "
"the potency of all the potion's effects. While these apparatus are not "
"necessary to create potions, it is advised that they be used whenever "
"possible.\n"
"\n"
"Ingredient Combination\n"
"\n"
"A potion is only as good as its ingredients. Only those with identical "
"effects may be combined to make a potion; up to four ingredients may be "
"successfully used in a single potion.\n"
"\n"
"As the Alchemist gains skill in preparing ingredients, new properties may be "
"discovered and can be used in creating potions. While this can be an "
"exciting time, expanding the Alchemist's repertoire, he should take care to "
"check carefully which effects his potions will contain when he is done "
"brewing. Many established recipes may have new results, not all of which are "
"beneficial."

"치료하는 포션을 만들 수 있다.(이것은 많은 연금술사들이 익히고 사용하지만, 조합에 있어서 많이 실수하기도 하는 공식이다.)\n"
"\n"
"숙련된 연금술사는 포션의 질을 높이기 위해 다른 도구들을 사용한다. 증류기(retort)는 혼합물을 정화하여 이로운 효과를 증폭시키는데 "
"쓰이며, 정화기(Alembic)은 부정적인 효과를 감소시킨다. 그리고 하소기(Caninator)는 혼합물의 불순물을 태워 포션의 모든 "
"효과를 증폭시킨다. 이러한 기계들은 포션을 만드는 데 꼭 필요한 것은 아니지만, 가능하면 사용할 것을 권한다.\n"
"\n"
"재료 조합\n"
"\n"
"포션은 그 재료의 질에 따라 효과가 달라진다. 동일한 효과일 경우에만 포션으로 만들어지며, 한 포션에서는 최대 네 가지의 효과만 나타난다."
"\n"

"연슴술사로서 재료를 준비하는데 익숙해졌다면 새로운 성분을 찾아낼 수 있을 것이며, 이 또한 포션을 만드는 데 이용할 수 있다. 이러한 "

"The origin of the mystic runestones found scattered across Tamriel is "
"obscure and uncertain. Even their nature and material composition is a "
"matter of hot debate among the sages of the Crystal Tower. The Venerable "
"Ancirinque, Sapiarch of Mythohistory, holds that certain difficult passages "
"in Torinaan's Journal indicate that runestones were already here when the "
"Foresailor arrived from Old Aldmeris. However, Nolin the Many-Hued, Sapiarch "
"of Enchantment, contends that they date from the early Merethic Era, and are "
"the unintended consequence of an Ayleid wizard's experiment gone awry. \n"
"\n"
"Whatever the truth of their origin, after generations of study by the finest "
"magical minds in the Summerset Isles, their various properties have nearly "
"all been identified, and their uses in the enchantment of arms, armor, and "
"ornaments are well understood. For general classification they fall into "
"three categories, which we latter-day mages have dubbed Potency, Aspect, and "
"Essence. \n"
"\n"
"For enchantment purposes these three types of runestones can be understood "
"as mystically complementary, for only by combining one of each category can "
"the enchanter create a \"\"glyph,\"\" our term for the magical substance we "
"use to endow an item with sorcerous power. \n"
"\n"
"However, though we know how to use runestones to create magical items, the "
"enigma remains: what are they? We have named their three standard categories "
"Potency, Aspect, and Essence—but what does that mean? Even the great Phariiz "
"the Antic, who gave them these names, even he, when asked what they meant, "
"merely shrugged and replied, \"\"Those are the names that feel right to me."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Even the fact that there are three kinds of runestones generates debate, as "
"it seems to contradict the Anu-Padu Theorem, which posits that duality is "
"the foundation of the Aurbis. Camilonwe of Lillandril asserted that it was "
"impossible that there were only three types of runestones, and spent the "
"last two hundred years of his life searching for a fourth, convinced that "
"proper classification called for such entities to appear in dual pairs. He "
"never found this \"\"quartonic runestone,\"\" which he dubbed Celerity, but "
"he insisted until the end that his theory was sound. \n"

"\n"
"As all schoolchildren know, northern Tamriel was invaded by a legion of "
"Akaviri raiders in 1E 2700. Mighty warriors with potent powers, these "
"Akaviri cut a swath through Skyrim, defeating all opponents, until they were "
"met at Pale Pass by a Cyrodilic army under the command of General Reman. "
"After a brief battle, the Akaviri surrendered en masse to Reman, saying that "
"in him, they had found what they had come to Tamriel to seek. \n"
"\n"
"With the Akaviri added to his own army, Reman marched on, pacifying most of "
"Tamriel, becoming Emperor, and founding the Second Empire. The best and "
"wisest of the Akaviri became the Dragonguard, under the Emperor Reman's "
"personal command. \n"
"\n"
"For the next two centuries the Dragonguard protected the Reman Dynasty, "
"defending the Emperors with abilities said to have been learned from the "
"Dragons themselves, which persisted in Akavir far longer than they did in "
"Tamriel. \n"
"\n"
"But when Reman III was assassinated in 2920, that was the end of the Reman "
"Dynasty (as well as the First Era). Officially the Dragonguard was "
"disbanded, some said in shame at having failed to protect the Emperor. "
"However, when the Potentate Versidue-Shaie assumed the Ruby Throne, the "
"Dragonguard was unofficially reactivated, more as an intelligence network "
"than as an honor guard. \n"
"\n"
"Other former members of the Dragonguard followed different pursuits. Some "
"joined their former centurion, Dinieras-Ves, when he founded the "
"organization that would come to be known as the Fighters Guild. Others "
"became roving adventurers, selling their services as combat trainers or "
"swords-for-hire. \n"
"\n"
"One of these was a former Dragonguard whose name is now lost, and is known "
"only to this chronicler as the Grandmaster. He took it upon himself to "
"ensure that the martial and mystical arts of the old Akaviri would survive "
"into the new and turbulent Second Era. However, he would teach his skills "
"only on condition that those he taught would go on to teach others. This was "

"In the generations since the fall of the Akaviri Potentates, a new martial "

"\n"
"Last night I was sitting in the Anchor's Point taproom, nursing a mug of rum "
"posset while poring over Ralliballah's Eleven Ritual Forms, when suddenly my "
"quiet corner was invaded by a tall, armored figure. I asked if he would "
"stand somewhere else, as he was blocking the light, but he replied something "
"to the effect that a handsome woman shouldn't be wasting a moons-lit evening "
"on reading, set a frothy tankard on the table and sat down next to me. \n"
"\n"
"Before I could protest he launched into the story of his life, the subject "
"of which—himself—he seemed very enthusiastic about. He was a product of the "
"north-coast port town of Fharun, where he'd grown up with the conviction he "
"was destined for bigger things. When he was old enough he'd left and made "
"his way to central High Rock, where he'd fallen in with an old half-Akaviri "
"arms-trainer who had taught him the ways of the so-called \"\"dragonknights."
"\"\" It was then that he finally found his true calling perfecting the form "
"of magical combat that the dragonknights refer to as \"\"ardent flame.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Blowhard or no, once he brought up the arcane arts he piqued my interest. I "
"asked him to tell me more about this discipline of martial magic, as I was "
"unfamiliar with it, and he was only too happy to oblige. With ardent flame, "
"he explained, the dragonknight could set his enemies afire, draw them to him "
"with a flaming lasso, wreath himself in a cloak of flame, even breathe fire "
"just like the legendary dragons of yore. And this was, he asserted, because "
"a dragonknight used actual dragon magic handed down from those mighty "
"warriors who fought and won a war with the dragons back before the First Era."
" \n"
"\n"
"It was this last claim where he lost me. Did he really expect me, a Mages "
"Guild sorcerer of the first rank, to believe that an unlearned lout like him "
"was casting spells using on long-lost dragon magic? I held up a hand, rather "
"peremptorily, and to my surprise (and perhaps his own) he actually stopped "
"talking. I told him I'd heard quite enough about his dragon magic, thank you "
"very much, and that as far as I was concerned it was no more than a variant "
"of our standard repertoire of flame spells, what the Shad Astula curriculum "
"categorizes as \"\"Destruction Magic.\"\" I desired him to withdraw and "
"allow me to return to my reading. \n"
"\n"
"He sputtered for a moment, but then gave a condescending smile and said "
"there was no need for the \"\"little lady\"\" to be afraid, as a dragon "
"could be gentle as well as fierce. Perhaps I didn't understand just how "
"ardent his flame could be. \n"
"\n"
"I warned him to be on his way, but he scoffed and persisted. It was when he "
"offered to show me his \"\"lava whip\"\" that I finally lost all patience. "
"It's a shame, because the proprietor of the Anchor's Point told me I would "
"no longer be welcome there, and I liked that place. \n"

"\n"
"It happens to every amateur or apprentice mage: that first time one miscasts "
"a shock spell. It recoils upon one, and one lets out a yip as all of one's "
"fur stands up straight and sparks jolt through one's form and out the tip of "
"one's tail. And one wonders seriously for the first time: lightning—what is "
"it?\n"
"\n"
"Listen to Mora'at, for this one is in a position to explain. After much hard "
"study and many repetitions of the entrance exam, Mora'at is now an "
"officially-recognized Journeyman of the Corinthe Mages Guildhall, and "
"therefore in a position to speak with some authority on magical matters. I "
"have been doing research into this matter of lightning—specializing, as we "
"scholars of the arcane do—and have also given the matter a not-"
"inconsiderable amount of thought on my own. \n"
"\n"
"As a result, this one has a Theory. \n"
"\n"
"Shock, like Flame and Frost, is an expression of magical power that takes "
"the form of a natural force. Everyone has played with this force when one "
"was a ja'khajiit, scuffing one's feet across a rug and then stinging a "
"sibling with a small spark from an extended claw, or rubbing an inflated "
"rat's-bladder against one's fur until the hairs stand up and the bladder "
"\"\"sticks\"\" to one's chest or arm. \n"
"\n"
"So it was apparent to this one, even from an early age, that shock was an "
"inherent property of fibrous matter, a property stimulated by friction into "
"sparks. This also explains lightning, as clouds, which resemble nothing so "
"much as huge Tenmar cotton-balls, generate shock when storms cause friction "
"through colliding masses of buoyant fiber. \n"
"\n"
"Therefore, when one of we mighty wizards of the Mages Guild casts a Shock "
"spell, what is actually happening? This one explains it as follows: the "
"reality of the Mundus is a great tapestry woven of strands of matter and "
"magicka. A Shock spell channels and manipulates magicka through the local "
"warp and weft of the tapestry, agitating its fibers. This generates "
"sparking, which coalesces into magical lightning. Yes? \n"
"\n"
"Perceptions such as these come easily once one is a skilled mage. When I "
"present this theory to our magister, this one anticipates well-earned praise "
"and encouragement. In fact, now that Mora'at is a bona fide magical scholar, "
"this one may even have another theory tomorrow!"

"A mage of supreme power and erudition such as myself may be called upon to "
"exercise his skills in almost any corner of farflung Tamriel, so for a "
"native of Morrowind I am widely traveled. Thus I can tell you with the "
"authority of personal experience that petty local officials, regardless of "
"race or culture, are universally suspicious and ill-informed. \"\"A "
"sorcerer, eh?,\"\" they say. \"\"Well, we'll have none of your raising the "
"dead in this jurisdiction, is that understood?\"\" \n"
"\n"
"I cannot tell you how many times I have been subjected to some variation of "
"the above conversation. These ignorant and self-important functionaries have "
"no conception whatsoever of distinctions within the arcane arts. As far as "
"they are concerned, every manipulator of magicka is just waiting for "
"midnight before skulking off to the cemetery to animate the corpses of their "
"neighbors and ancestors. \n"
"\n"
"Imbeciles. Fools. BUREAUCRATS.\n"
"\n"
"Now, it is true, of course, that conjuration is a common tool of sorcery, "
"and we sorcerers often resort to summoning aid from Oblivion when a problem "
"is best solved by judicious application of vicious brute force. It is also "
"true that summoning Daedric spirits to possess and animate corpses, or "

"necromancy—is a subset of the art of conjuration, albeit inherently "
"distasteful and degrading. However, to infer from this that all sorcerers "
"are de facto necromancers as well is false, misleading, and libelous. \n"

"That said, everyone was young once, and it's typical of youth to experiment "

"—Introduction—\n"
"\n"
"Conjuration is the arcane art of summoning creatures and items from other "
"planes for the usage and benefit of the conjurer. Its study has long "
"languished due to its inherent perils, for summoned entities, particularly "
"the more intelligent Daedra, resent being brought to Nirn to do another's "
"bidding, and often seek to do the conjurer a mischief. \n"
"\n"
"The notable success I have had in formulating safe and reliable conjuration "
"spells comes from my system of defining such magics as always having two "
"essential and interlocking components: a summoning incantation and a binding "
"rune. It is the latter part, of course, that protects the conjurer from the "
"entity or item summoned by enthralling it to the summoner. \n"
"\n"
"Heretofore conjuration has been quite a dangerous pursuit due to the fact "
"that a conjuring wizard had to cast summoning and binding as two separate "
"spells, and if the binding was miscast or cast too slowly, the conjurer "
"might pay for the error with his life. My innovation has been to interweave "
"the magics of summoning and binding so that they become one spell that "
"manifests both effects simultaneously, thus ensuring that what is summoned "
"is also necessarily bound. \n"
"\n"
"The apprentice is urged to apply himself diligently to study of the spells "
"in the accompanying grimoire: though my methods have rendered conjuration "
"less perilous, it is by no means an art to be attempted lightly and "
"carelessly. The apprentice who does so will only briefly be a burden to his "
"or her master."

"It is unfortunate that the arcane discipline known as \"\"Dark Magic\"\" has "
"acquired such a pejorative name in the common parlance, as it tends to "
"relegate the practitioners into that class of sorcerer slanderously known as "
"\"\"evil wizards.\"\" To counteract such dangerous libels, it is handy to "
"keep in mind the following three pretexts:\n"
"\n"
"PRETEXT THE FIRST: Insofar as it negates, drains, and preys upon the magicka "
"and power of other mages, knowledge of Dark Magic is a necessary safeguard "
"that enables the reining in of rogue sorcerers. \n"
"\n"
"PRETEXT THE SECOND: Insomuch as it replicates some of the deleterious "
"effects of spells cast by inimical Daedra, knowledge of Dark Magic is a "
"useful tool for learning how to counter said effects. \n"
"\n"
"PRETEXT THE THIRD: Whereas its application is regarded by the ignorant as "
"frightful and loathsome, use of Dark Magic to inflict condign punishment "
"upon transgressors is a deterrent to crime and therefore a social good. \n"
"\n"
"That should silence the critics."

"As Tamriel's leading wizard, I have often been called upon, usually by "
"individuals of royal birth, to impress them with some demonstration of my "
"magical skills. When I ask what they'd like to see, they nearly always "
"reply, \"\"Throw a fireball! A really big one. I'd love that.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"This just shows how poorly educated Tamriel's aristocrats are about the "

"magical scholar gives pride of place in his grimoire to the Shock spells. "
"For whatever reason, manipulating arcane lightning is easier than forcing "
"magical flame, and it can be employed for a greater variety of effects. Here "
"are just a few:\n"
"\n"
"—The mage can cloak himself in an aura of lightning that will turn aside "
"certain physical and magical attacks, as well as shocking nearby enemies.\n"
"\n"
"—Lightning can be cast on a surface in the form of a rune that will explode "
"if touched or after a certain delay. \n"
"\n"
"—A wizard can cast a bolt to a nearby target and then instantly \"\"ride the "
"lightning\"\" to that destination.\n"
"\n"
"—And, of course, lightning bolts can be cast directly at enemies in a number "
"of variations. \n"
"\n"
"It is possible, I suppose, that ways to manipulate Frost and Flame will be "
"discovered that make those elemental magics as flexible as Shock—but if I "
"haven't discovered how to do it, who else could?"

"There is one very important thing that I have learned much about in my years."
" Oh yes, and another. There are two very important things I know about, and "
"those two things are fighting and dancing. You will forgive me for sometimes "
"confusing the two, for they are each one close to the other, side by side, "
"partners like so many things under the moons.\n"
"\n"
"To fight and to dance, your feet must be light, fast, never stumbling. "
"Whether it is a battle or a celebration, in each, a stumble means death, "
"means the sword across your neck or the stab of embarrassment and rejection. "
"One foot and two, each sure where it lands on this beat and the next. You "
"must be bold. Take the lead and your partner and enemy will follow; you will "
"be master of the movements, impressive and strong.\n"
"\n"
"You must inspire; you must project the power inside forth and out. Consider: "
"what dancer wishes to engage with the beggar, filthy and low? What enemy "
"will fear you if you are shabby and wear dingy padding? Best to prepare, to "
"choose the right garments to show who you are and who you intend to be. You "
"intend to be the winner. The best.\n"
"\n"
"Fadomai knew we needed Jone and Jode to protect us and guide us, and "
"likewise you must use the left and right hands. The moons are different, but "
"they are both moons, and, just so, you shall hold a weapon in each hand for "
"battle. Maybe not the same weapon, but weapons still. The moons are both "
"circles, not a circle and a square. For dance, it is the same; you hold the "
"hands—left and right in right and left, but hands all the same.\n"
"\n"
"In the fight and the dance, there is rhythm. Give and take, ebb and flow. "
"Mastery of movement, of spinning and twirling just at the right times, is "
"what you must display. You must know when to move forward and when to leap "
"back, watching the other for cues. The other is just another side of "
"you—ignore them at your peril. There is no feeling to compare with a good "
"fight or dance. If you practice, you feel each piece falling into place, "
"each motion flowing exactly to where it should. And that is how you win."

"When the mighty Ra Gada first drove back the Orcs, one sect of warriors "
"employed a fighting style so aggressive, so fierce, that the tales tell of "
"enemies standing stunned, falling to flashing blades in a daze before they "
"realized an attack was upon them. These champions revered Tava as well as "
"Diagna, engraving their blades with the wings of a hawk. The bird's keen "
"sight, accuracy, and rending claws inspired their sword-songs, and "
"references to the sun and light are numerous. Sadly, little remains of their "
"tradition, aside from what I have pieced together from crumbling tablets and "
"monuments deep in the desert.\n"
"\n"
"It is clear that these warriors, the Glinting Talons, wielded a sword in "
"each hand. They are mentioned often in inscriptions dating to the arrival "
"from Yokuda for their great deeds—driving off warbands of Orcs when sorely "
"outnumbered, capturing strongholds in surprise attacks, and many other "
"heroic tales. Of their style, though, very little is known. This partial "
"inscription I located at the site of the Battle of Six Hands is all that has "
"been recovered regarding their way of the blade:\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Face the burdensome sun. Carry its weight face-wise. Submit to the "
"endless edges twinned.\n"
"Master these strikes in the morning; cleave the light and leave the foe in "
"darkness:\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Two Blades Become Four\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Lion's Teeth Exposed in Thunder\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Five Arrows Split the Sky\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The Screech of Descent upon Helpless Prey\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Master these strikes in the evening; chase the enemy and burn its flesh."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I can find no other references or descriptions of these strikes, and it "
"saddens me to think that such knowledge of the blade has been lost. I have "
"no greater desire than to restore this lost way of the blade, but the "
"fragments are so few. The mystery compels me to continue my travels in hopes "
"that, perhaps, I will be led by Tava's grace to discover more, and return "
"this shamefully lost knowledge to our people."

"We never knew where he came from. He showed up during our assault on the "
"Rotwood Butchers, a nasty group that'd taken to terrorizing travelers a "
"couple days out of Evermore. We found their hideout, but were caught off "
"guard when more were inside than we expected; there must have been an "
"entrance we didn't see. They had us pinned, trapped in the filthy caves "
"they'd claimed, when out of nowhere he came clanking down the hall, covered "
"head to toe in shining plate and cleaving bandits in half with every swing. "
"The tide turned. One after another, Rotwood scoundrels fell to his blade "
"until none were left.\n"
"\n"
"I thanked him and asked his name, but he didn't respond. Confused, I tried "
"introducing myself, telling him about our company and the work we'd been "
"taking on to clear out bandits and beasts all over northern Bangkorai. "
"Nothing. Frustrated and a little disturbed, we left the cave and headed back "
"to camp. He followed. I told him he wasn't welcome if he was going to keep "
"up the silent treatment and hide his face from us, but it didn't help. "
"Everyone was on edge, uneasy. We didn't see any signs of aggression, and I "
"don't think anyone wanted to raise a sword to challenge him after the "
"carnage with the Rotwoods earlier.\n"
"\n"
"It just went on like that. He never talked at all. He took his food alone, "
"off away from the camp, and never seemed to sleep; he just propped himself "
"up against a tree or a rock at night, never once taking off a piece of that "
"armor. None of us had seen the like of it before, all smooth, rounded pieces "
"with strange feathery engravings. It was beautiful, silver with dark swirls, "
"covering him entirely. We were uncomfortable at first (and who wouldn't "
"be?), but he never hurt anyone aside from the bandits we rooted out. And by "
"Stendarr, did he ever hurt them!\n"
"\n"
"We warmed to his presence, probably because he saved our skins over and over."
" His was the blow that ended Swampheart the Fetid, a filthy hag that had "

"down—all but him. He was the one who saved Riles-the-Leaves from being "
"tossed over a cliff by the boar Bloodgut, who'd assailed several farmers and "
"their livestock. He even saved my own life more than once. He was tireless, "
"fearless, and, it seemed, dedicated to our goals.\n"
"\n"
"I wonder to this day if he had a name, if he was even a \"\"he.\"\" I don't "
"guess we'll ever know. Six months he tromped along with us on our contracts, "
"and for those six months we prospered more than ever; we even added new "
"blood to our roster. When winter came on, we headed back to Evermore for our "
"usual time off (it's slow getting good work in the cold months), and one "
"morning, he was gone. No sign, no tracks, nothing. Just disappeared. No one "
"I've spoken to has ever heard of him or anything like him, and I get a lot "
"of funny looks when I tell the tale. No matter. Wherever he is, I hope he's "
"doing well and carrying on the good work."

"In studying history, one often encounters tales of exceptional arms and "

"a historian and scholar to preserve any details of such items, even those "

"Commissioned by an unknown Dark Elven general, this ebony chestplate was "
"engraved with the names of the Dunmer saints and their teachings. According "
"to the tales, the artisan tried to explain to the general that etching the "
"names and stories into the plate would weaken its integrity, but to no avail."
" The general demanded completion of the piece. Three costly cuirasses "
"shattered or cracked as the crafter attempted the feat, attempting to "
"configure the names and parables in an arrangement that would hold. He "
"consulted with priests and enchanters, and by his fourth attempt, the plate "
"was complete. It is said that nothing short of a Daedric Prince itself could "

"\n"
"References to this incredible work are few. I have seen a few texts "

"produce plate-like coverings whenever the wearer wills. It is said to be the "
"crowning achievement of a powerful High Elven alchemist who stopped at "
"nothing, including horrific experimentation on live subjects, to reach the "
"result. Only a very few vials are thought to exist, as the process for "

"not fit well, and hefted his sword, determined to drive the necromancers "

"There are those who will tell you that in order to become powerful, you must "
"focus your energies, that you must pursue one discipline to the exclusion of "
"all others if you wish to be remembered for great deeds. Utterly ridiculous. "
"Why be the master of one thing alone when you have the capacity to become so "
"much more? \n"
"\n"
"I see this way of thinking emphasized especially among fellow practitioners "
"of magic. So often, students are discouraged from exploring the virtues of "
"physical modes of combat or other studies in favor of complete and total "
"dedication to magic—even to areas of the art in which they have no interest "
"or talent. \n"
"\n"
"It seems such a waste to raise a generation of mages who focus less and less "
"on practical applications and more on obscure theories and experiments. If "
"you find yourself similarly disenfranchised, then allow me to open your eyes "
"to new possibilities. Step boldly forth and do not hesitate to open new "
"avenues of study.\n"
"\n"
"Tamriel has a fine tradition of battlemages—arcanists who apply their "
"considerable intelligence and magical skill to the mastery of spells that "
"are devastating in combat while being unafraid to pick up a sword and strap "
"on heavy armor, fighting in the front lines to turn the tides of battle. "
"Some of the most powerful heroes throughout history have combined magic and "
"physical prowess, and I wish to see more walk this path.\n"
"\n"
"Do you want to seek glory on the battlefield and strike terror into your "
"foes? Then master both the physical and the arcane. What could be more "
"frightening than a blast of fire shooting forth from an armored gauntlet? "
"Lightning striking nearby foes as your armor absorbs blows from all around? "
"True power means eliminating all weaknesses, and that can only be achieved "
"through knowledge and experience in multiple areas.\n"
"\n"
"If you come from a magical background, chances are you've never been taught "
"to properly wield a weapon or wear armor that offers any real protection. "
"Find someone to train you, even if you must face scoffing and taunts in the "
"beginning. Even the weakest (in the physical sense) sorcerer can develop the "
"strength needed to don heavy armor pieces. \n"
"\n"
"It is also possible to practice magic at the same time as combat. By doing "
"so, you will attain incredible levels of concentration, improve your "
"stamina, and learn to weave spell and sword together. This allows you to "
"adapt to any challenge. Too many who study magic neglect their bodies, "
"becoming vulnerable when magicka runs low.\n"
"\n"
"Become more than a one-dimensional stereotype, and you will discover that, "
"by diversifying, you build a set of skills that can adapt to any situation. "
"Being the most powerful does not mean simply being very good at one thing. "
"You have the potential for so much more. Expand your repertoire, and when "
"you step onto the field of battle, wherever it is and no matter who your foe "
"is, you will be prepared for anything."

"\n"
"We were young and optimistic when we set forth, striking out on the rumor of "
"a ruin untouched, lost among the crags and misty peaks of the Jerall "
"Mountains on the Skyrim-Cyrodiil border. Our maps were inadequate, as were "
"our plans and preparations. Nearly starved, frostbitten, and lost, it was "
"only by sheer luck that we even stumbled onto the entrance, which sat half-"
"buried and covered in a layer of ice high in the peaks.\n"
"\n"
"By the time we cracked open the door, locked by a combination of mechanical "
"and arcane mechanisms, our supplies had dwindled dangerously low. But it was "
"worth it. As the barrier separated and we saw into the gloom, it was clear "
"that the rumor was true: this place was long undisturbed, unmarred by "
"robbers and scavengers. Who knew what we would find inside?\n"
"\n"
"We could never have guessed at the answer. The entry hall itself was very "
"unusual. It featured a gleaming metal staircase, ornately molded and "
"engraved with strange glyphs and angular emblems. As soon as my boot touched "
"the first step, a clear tone rang out into the cold, startling us all. Every "
"footfall created a new, sweet sound as we descended to the bottom, eager to "
"escape the chill and reinvigorated by the prospect of discovery.\n"
"\n"
"Fifty men could have stretched head to toe across the circular chamber that "
"opened before us at the base of the stair. Its high dome receded into "
"shadow, and ringed all around the center of the floor were thirteen massive "
"statues, posed with arms extended to the side and legs shoulder-width apart. "
"Each was clad in a unique suit of armor. Every suit was crafted from a "
"different material, some of which were recognizable (steel, ebony, and iron "
"among them), but several could not be identified at first look. \n"
"\n"
"Many of the suits boasted strange, angular plates of metal or precious stone "
"affixed to the joints or helms, and some featured engraved patterns and "
"phrases. The construction of the place imparted a sense of reverence; the "
"careful placements and grand scale made the chamber feel almost holy. We "
"crept among the statues, marveling at the armor and wishing we had more "
"knowledge of smithing and metalwork.\n"
"\n"
"In the center of them all stood a bronze monolith, thirteen-sided and "
"engraved from top to bottom with characters and diagrams that seemed related "
"to the armors worn by the statues. We approached the monument, but, lost in "
"our wonder at the mysteries before us, we forgot we were intruders, "
"neglected the caution necessary in such places. I reached out a hand to "
"touch the metal, and as soon as my skin made contact, chaos erupted.\n"
"\n"
"I remember little but the screams of my companions, bright flashes of light, "
"and a mad dash to the staircase, which produced a cacophony as I scrambled "
"up it and out onto the snow. I realized then that I was alone. Injured and "
"heartbroken at the loss of my expeditionary allies, I made it to a small "
"village only by the grace of the Divines. I was never able to locate the "
"entrance again, but its secrets still wait, hidden in the snow."

"laughing. Then I was awake, but the laughter wasn't gone; hooting, high-"
"pitched laughter coming from the trees. The guard on watch, that Argonian "
"whose name I can't pronounce, he didn't see anything. We scouted around, but "
"the laughing stopped, and then we all just sat by the fire feeling uneasy. I "

"Things are just getting weirder. Today, we were slashing our way forward "

"Maxintius spotted giant beetles up ahead on the trail. Not just big "
"bugs—huge bugs. Bugs the size of wolves. Massive pinchers, shiny shells. "
"They weren't doing much, just crawling around, but we hadn't seen their like "
"so far and approached slowly. When I got within a short stone's throw, I "
"noticed something strange about their legs. They looked like a man's! They "
"were! In a flash, they stood up and rushed towards us, running and flipping "
"and laughing, covered in beetle shells and grabbing things from the camp "
"before disappearing off into the trees. We tried to give chase. The Argonian "
"fired a quick arrow, but it bounced right off that carapace armor. Were "

"to be what happened. Who knows how they got to it or what they put in it, "
"but when we woke up in the middle of the night, skeletons were dancing "
"around the campfire. I couldn't move, could only watch in a haze and listen "
"to the strange music, the rattling and hissing and low, warped flutes. Were "
"they wearing bones? It's all fuzzy except one thing: we are getting out of "
"here, profits be damned!"

"Azarrid observed the dispute, leaning against the cool stone of the ancient "

"concealed blades swung from the walls, slicing in deadly arcs across the "
"hall. A blade sped towards Lodissar and crashed against his armor, pushing "
"him aside. Unharmed, he laughed as Azarrid, keeping pace, nimbly dodged the "
"deadly trap. Pamolwe was not so fortunate or skilled. Her wards shattered "
"under the blows. Frantic, she tried to stop short of a blade in front of "
"her, but her foot became entangled in her robe. She fell headfirst into its "
"path. \n"
"\n"
"Azarrid did not stop to look back, but jogged behind Lodissar, who continued "
"his shouting. The enormous gem was close now, almost within reach. Assured "
"of his victory, he turned to loose a final insult when the stones beneath "
"his feet crumbled. He tumbled downward, clanging and flailing in his steel "
"armor as it pulled him into a deep pool. Muffled screams sounded from the "
"water as whatever lurked inside stirred.\n"
"\n"
"In a quick leap, the triumphant Khajiit stood before the gem, illuminated by "
"its light. Snatching it up, he turned to look back down the trapped hallway. "
"\"\"Seems Azarrid is the best adventurer today, dear friends,\"\" he "

"Flexibility or maximum protection? Netch or guar? Maybe you've heard one of "
"the heated arguments, fueled by a few too many cups of mazte at your local "
"cornerclub. Almost every craftsman takes an almost religious stance on this "
"matter, believing his own approach, traditions, and products to be superior "

"considerations in an unbiased manner to help inform your own opinion.\n"
"\n"
"The best leather in Tamriel comes from Morrowind, courtesy of the native "
"guar and netches. This is an indisputable fact, and no other leathers "
"produced in Tamriel come close to their quality. The naturally-exposed hides "
"of these beasts and the ease of processing them, combined with ancient "
"tanning techniques, produce a material that is more durable and tougher than "
"bear, mammoth, or any of the hides commonly used outside Morrowind. Though "
"both are of very high quality, the debate rages on—which makes superior "
"armor? \n"
"\n"
"Netch leather is thinner by quite a bit. It bends and flexes easily, and it "
"is much more receptive to dyes than guar hide, and therefore more suitable "
"for finer, more ornamental works. It is likewise ideal for the combatant who "
"prefers mobility, but it is much more readily punctured and torn, even when "
"boiled to increase toughness. Another difficulty is that it requires "
"relatively high maintenance—to keep it in fighting shape, it must be oiled "
"and treated with dreugh wax weekly. Netch leather is harder to harvest, as "
"well; the beasts are quite dangerous when riled and have a nasty poison that "
"even experienced netchimen fear. \n"
"\n"
"Guar hide, on the other hand, is much thicker, resulting in heavier armors "
"overall (though still not as heavy, obviously, as armors crafted from metal)."
" This makes it more difficult to work with, but the end product offers more "
"protection and durability. Staunch traditionalists frequently claim that "
"guar hide has been used longer than netch leather, and that we honor our "
"ancestors in favoring it, but I have been able to locate no proof of this "
"point. If you're more interested in protection than in mobility, guar hide "
"armor is likely a better choice for you.\n"
"\n"
"Even though every craftsman seems to have an unwavering opinion on which "
"leather results in superior armors, I am not swayed by either side. It "
"occurs to me that the choice is largely on the wearer, depending on his or "
"her own fighting style (though armorers are never shy to offer "
"recommendations in this regard, either). Hopefully, you are more informed "
"now about your options, and whether you choose netch, guar, or an unorthodox "
"combination of both, I wish you luck on the battlefield."

"\n"
"Rashes, foul stench, contagion, fungus. None of these are pleasant, but they "
"are all controllable if a warrior takes the proper steps. As an accomplished "
"alchemist with ten years of experience on the battlefield, I've seen the "
"worst of war camps, and I have developed several methods that lessen the "
"occurrence of common threats to health. If you follow my advice, you will be "
"able to avoid the problems that many soldiering types simply accept as the "
"part of the cost of battle.\n"
"\n"
"First and foremost, it is critical to bathe. Yes, bathe. Truly, there may "
"not be many opportunities to do so, but as soon as it is possible after a "
"day's march or a battle, bathing and applying a salve of shalk resin and "
"crushed bergamot seeds have been proven to repel parasites such as toe-"
"borers, grassfleas, and fleshbloats. Anyone who has seen battle knows that "
"soldiers' camps are breeding grounds for such vile creatures, and prevention "
"is surely the best remedy. \n"
"\n"
"Another important factor to consider is your environment. In order to avoid "
"several types of discomfort, you must be prepared to do combat with the "
"landscape as well as your enemy. For travel in desert regions, apply a "
"powder of dragon's tongue to prevent chafing. In swamps, use waxes and "
"thoroughly waterproof your boots to prevent fungal assailants. Remember that "
"insects often carry disease, and keep repellant salves and potions to treat "
"common sicknesses handy—don't rely on your superiors to provide them!\n"
"\n"
"Though my advice will help any soldier or adventurer, I'd like to devote a "
"few words to leather armor in particular. Some individuals have negative "
"reactions to leathers, and many never even know their armor may be suspect! "
"I see this particularly with netch armor and leathers crafted from bears or "
"sabre cats native to Skyrim (especially if any fur is present). If you are "
"issued armor and do not have a choice in what to wear, always carry with you "
"a tincture of elf cup cap to apply to irritated areas.\n"
"\n"
"With just a few simple, inexpensive preparations, you can avoid these lesser "
"horrors of war and focus your energy on combat and marching without "
"distraction. Take care of yourself on the battlefield. If you don't, you're "
"guaranteed a miserable experience that will compound the fatigue of war. Be "
"aware and always be prepared!"

"\n"
"Students of the magical arts in our chaotic contemporary environs must "
"resist succumbing to the degradation of respect for tradition which "
"threatens the future of magical study across Tamriel. The disregard for "
"ritual I have seen and the reduction of complexities inherent in the study "
"to crass, inadequate categorizations is not to be tolerated. Feeble though "
"my efforts may be, I must do my best to confront this watering-down, the "
"devolution of the highest arts into common \"\"practical\"\" applications, "
"by recording the proper approaches to be shared with those who wish to "
"pursue the study seriously. I shall start with the fundamentals: the proper "
"garments for a true initiate of the arts.\n"
"\n"
"There is only one appropriate attire for anyone who wishes to unlock the "
"higher secrets, for one who devotes the proper time to research and "
"practice, and that is robes of cloth. On a practical level, one need not "
"waste precious time being instructed in the ways of wearing robes. Magic is "
"your armor, and devoting your time to anything else is folly. If you wish to "
"lower yourself to such vulgar means, don't be surprised when your efforts to "
"wrangle with leather or metal stunt your progress in the realm of the true "
"understanding of magicka and its applications.\n"
"\n"
"There are considerations you must take into account, of course; not any "
"filthy rags will suffice. Physically, the material should be sturdy and "
"treated for resistance to the elements. Your experiments will result in "
"exposure to dangerous effects, so long sleeves and full coverage are "
"essential. As alchemy is naturally aligned with magical study, pockets and "
"pouches for useful plant samples and other materials are very useful. If you "
"cannot afford to hire your own exploratory teams and must work in the field, "
"ensure proper layering, waterproofing, and additional space for specimens.\n"
"\n"
"Of course, appearance is critical. One must put forth the proper air of the "
"enlightened to command respect from allies and enemies alike. My own robes "
"feature detailed embroidery enumerating and naming the most powerful "
"individuals of my lineage, along with sacred incantations I have interwoven "
"with protective wards. Some prefer to display detailed Aetherial charts or "
"other complex weavings to emphasize a particular area of study, and at least "
"one wizard I am acquainted with has woven such potent illusions into his "
"raiment that all who look upon him see exactly what they expect a powerful "
"wizard to wear. \n"
"\n"
"Your robes are an extension of yourself and your ability to impress your "
"will upon the Mundus. I implore again that you abandon any ridiculous ideas "
"of charging into battle clad in pointless, constricting armor, and instead "
"focus on perfecting your art in every way. You will not require mundane "
"protections when you are able to turn enemies aside using your own power, "
"whatever form you choose for it to take: mighty lightning strikes, poisoning "
"minds with fear, or any of the limitless options you will have if you truly "
"devote yourself to discovery and mastery."

"Our settlement at Slithering Eaves was once prosperous; it was green and "
"unfurling, a haven under sun and branch. We lived deep enough within the "
"marsh that outsiders never visited, and the threat of slavers from House "
"Dres of Morrowind seemed distant. We believed slaver attacks only happened "
"to other Saxhleel. Even if they did come for us, our sentries had bright "
"eyes and quick arrows; they laughed at the thought of Elves splashing "
"towards our home. \n"
"\n"
"We underestimated the greed and cunning of House Dres. They came in the "
"darkest coils of night, their hateful Elven magics shielding them from our "
"watchers. They walked across the water, light as motes on a breeze even in "
"their ebony plate, silent as the pools they crossed. Fiery arrows scattered "
"us while Dunmeri magic lulled villagers to sleep, and comatose bodies were "
"dragged off under covering fire. Though we attempted pursuit, many of our "
"warriors were sapped by heavy magic that pulled their feet under the mud.\n"
"\n"
"We debated what to do as dawn crept over our homes, withered and wounded by "
"the Elves' attack. Voices called for us to flee, but Xil-Go's voice rang out "
"above the others. \"\"No! We shall not let these dryskin plunderers take us "
"or our village. We cannot. Please allow me just one day, and I will find a "
"way to turn them away for good.\"\" We were eager to defend our village, and "
"Xil-Go knew something of the ways of magic and mysteries, and so we all "
"agreed to her request.\n"
"\n"
"She disappeared into her hut and stayed inside throughout the day, not even "
"pausing to eat. The villagers grew restless as the sun dipped low. Finally "
"she emerged. \"\"I know what we must do. Any of you who can work even the "
"faintest magic, come with me. If you can shoot a bow, arm yourself with "
"arrows and these poisons I have made. We will need your protection when they "
"return.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The village waited. When the next attack came, we were ready. Expecting us "
"to be easy prey again, they came exactly the same way—walking upon the water "
"and making no sounds. They did not expect the wards, which exploded in "
"bright blasts of light, giving the signal for our archers to shoot and for "
"Xil-Go and the others to begin their spell. The slavers recovered from their "
"shock quickly and charged forward, still a formidable and well-armed force.\n"
"\n"
"Then it started. You could see the uncertainty in their pinched faces as the "
"spell began to blossom. Next came the howls of pain, the smell of ashen "
"flesh sizzling as the armor grew hotter and hotter. The Elves scrambled to "
"protect themselves, trying to rip off the heavy plates or cool them down "
"with their own magics, but it was too late for them to recover. Our warriors "
"fell on the intruders, and not one Elf escaped.\n"
"\n"
"We spread word of our victory, sending the tale far and wide through the "
"villages, knowing the story would take root in our enemies' ears. To this "
"day, I hear the slavers are reluctant to wear heavy armors into raids. Most "
"wear much lighter armor now, even if it does make them easier targets for "
"our archers. And that is fine with us."

"As you requested, here is my monthly report:\n"
"\n"
"Training for our new recruits progresses well among all squads save one. The "
"cavalry, archers, and footmen have come a long way since last month and are "
"performing advanced maneuvers and mixed squad exercises ahead of schedule. "
"The new band of healers from the Temple of Akatosh that you assigned to me, "
"however, lags behind in training, and I believe we must change our approach "
"dramatically if this unit is to succeed. Still, I think it is very likely "
"that we can achieve your goal to bolster our front lines with battle-ready "
"healers!\n"
"\n"
"Most of these recruits, I have learned, have a background in only civil "
"temple service. Per your instructions, I attempted to train them the same as "
"any normal soldier, issuing them standard steel armor and a sword or mace, "
"and ordering them to participate in drills with the other footmen. This has "
"resulted in disruption of our training regimens as they stumble around and "
"attempt to determine which end of the sword should be applied to the enemy.\n"
"\n"
"This experience has shown me that we should not hope to turn them into "
"soldiers that just happen to know how to heal a wound or two. Instead, we "
"must capitalize on their unique abilities to conjure wards and invigorate or "
"heal our troops. I am convinced they need specialized equipment and request "
"authorization to have sets of light, padded armor crafted—not robes, which "
"they are used to but would surely cause them trouble on the field, but "
"sturdy cloth with appropriate padding. I believe this will allow them to "
"better focus on and carry out their duties, namely getting to injured "
"comrades quickly and efficiently, prolonging our battlefield presence, and "
"improving our soldiers' fighting capacity.  \n"
"\n"
"I believe that splitting them into groups of two or three and situating them "
"along the back of the main thrust is critical. This way, at least one can "
"maintain protective wards on a particular squad as the others scan the lines "
"for comrades in danger. If they must get into hand-to-hand combat, they can "
"support each other with these protective magics, but we may also be wise to "
"train them in the use of at least a short sword.\n"
"\n"
"You were correct in seeing the great potential these recruits have for our "
"regiment. I believe in this unit, and I do not think we should waste any "
"further time attempting to force them into a typical soldierly mold. With "
"your permission, I feel we can and will forge a true advantage over our "
"enemies.\n"

"I was there, on the caravan where it started. I still can't bring myself to "
"travel; the fear paralyzes me every time I think about leaving. \n"
"\n"
"Almost a year ago, I was headed into Elsweyr for the Mages Guild to do "
"research on plants native to Dune. They sent me along with a large caravan, "
"one that was well-guarded. Despite being an infrequent traveler, I felt safe "
"among the guards and heavy wagons.\n"
"\n"
"That illusion shattered only four days into our journey. In the morning, as "
"we prepared for our departure, I heard that one of the late-night watch had "
"gone missing. At first, my traveling companions shrugged it off, assuming "
"he'd just abandoned his post (which is apparently common), but we discovered "
"his pack as we continued loading up. We set out anyway, the question of what "
"had happened hanging over us.\n"
"\n"
"By mid-day, one of the Khajiiti guards spotted something ahead of us on the "
"trail. He scouted forward to investigate, and if a Khajiit can look pale, he "
"did upon returning. He went straight to the caravan master, saying nothing. "
"After some prying, I learned that the Khajiit found the guard's body, "
"propped up in our path. Rumor had it that there was one arrow through his "
"throat, marked with the word \"\"Bliss.\"\" \n"
"\n"
"He was only the first. Every night, another guard went missing. Every day, "
"his body was discovered on the trail ahead of us, an arrow marked with the "
"word \"\"Bliss\"\" through the throat. The caravan was in turmoil. Some "
"begged to turn back, but we were more than halfway to Dune by then, and the "
"caravan master wouldn't hear of it. No one slept, guards were put on double "
"duty, campfires were built all along the perimeter—but without fail, someone "
"still disappeared every night. We took to constant travel, sleeping in "
"shifts on the backs of the lurching wagons.\n"
"\n"
"I woke from a fitful sleep two days out from Dune to discover my wagon had "
"stopped moving. Bleary, I slowly sat up and peered over the wagon's side. "
"All around me lay bodies. Every single remaining member of the caravan lay "
"dead, with an arrow marked \"\"Bliss\"\" through the throat. I scrambled "
"from one to another, trying to find any sign of life, but soon gave up and "
"collapsed. Who or what could do this? Why? Why inscribe that word onto the "
"arrows?\n"
"\n"
"The two days from then to Dune are a blur. I was certain they'd find me, "
"that they or he or it had just missed me. It feels now like I was supposed "
"to escape, supposed to tell the tale. No one believed me—when I rode out "
"with the town guard to the site of the massacre, nothing was there. Not a "
"trace. I wondered if I had gone mad, but only a week later more reports "
"started coming in of phantom archers playing the cruel game with caravan "
"after caravan, always using arrows marked \"\"Bliss.\"\"\n"

"tighter, unwilling to reach out. A deranged cackle rang through her head, "
"and the world heaved again under her feet.\n"
"\n"
"The clearing was gone. Regaining her footing, Allice glanced over her "
"shoulder and saw forms writhing in the dark foliage, a jumble of gleaming "
"eyes, moonlight on slavering maws, and howls of beasts and riders. A low "
"horn blasted and the wood vibrated, rattling her teeth, and the darkness "
"behind her surged. She ran.\n"
"\n"
"Arrows sailed past her as she sprinted. A spear flew over her shoulder. They "
"were gaining; she could hear their mad scrambling draw closer, but didn't "
"dare look back. Desperate, she leaped high, reaching out for a tree limb. "
"She pulled herself up just as a set of jagged teeth closed on the air where "
"she was only seconds before. \n"
"\n"
"Wasting no time, she turned, readied an arrow, and let fly, relieved to hear "
"a howl of pain from the beast below. She targeted another and another, but "
"more arrived, howling and yipping. The creatures and their riders encircled "
"the base of Allice's refuge. She clambered upward into thick branches that "
"offered her cover, but she couldn't lean out far enough to take aim. She was "
"trapped.\n"
"\n"
"There was one hope. The branches in the canopy were entwined and dense. If "
"she could jump far enough to reach a sturdy branch, she might be able to "
"keep moving. Just as she stretched out to test a nearby limb, she slipped as "
"her roost shook violently. Struggling to keep her grip, she looked down to "
"see a mass of thick black fur and shining teeth ram into the base of the "
"bole with its hulking shoulder. Its rider, the antlered hunter, pointed its "
"foul spear at her just as the trunk toppled.\n"
"\n"
"She crashed to the ground, grasping at branches and twisting as she tumbled "
"through the gnarled limbs. There was a sickening crack as she landed. She "
"recovered her bow and struggled to stand, falling forward as pain shot up "
"her leg. The monster raced toward her, panting with anticipation.\n"
"There was no escape. Allice's instincts took hold, and she aimed and shot "
"quickly. Before the first arrow even found its mark, she shot at the rider "
"again, and again. A howl of rage echoed in her mind, and she closed her "
"eyes, waiting for the rending jaws to close on her.\n"
"\n"
"The pain didn't come. When she opened her eyes, Allice knew where she was. "
"She could see the stars glimmering through the sparse canopy, saw the "
"torches at her shack in the valley far below. Wincing, she fashioned a rough "
"splint for her leg and reached out for her bow. On its upper limb, inlaid in "
"shimmering red, the outline of a pair of small antlers glistened."

"\n"
"To truly master anything, you must leave everything you know behind. When I "
"set out to travel Tamriel in search of new techniques, some already called "
"me a master of the bow. I knew this wasn't true. I'd heard tales from "
"distant lands about hunters who could sit motionless for days stalking "
"elusive prey, of bowmen who could fire two and three arrows at a time and "
"still hit their marks, and other, similar stories everyone assured me were "
"just legends and hearsay. Every legend starts somewhere.\n"
"\n"
"The Wood Elves are renowned archers, so I traveled first to Valenwood. The "
"journey into the heart of the forest itself was long and fraught with perils "
"I had never known.  I spent months searching for a teacher, challenging "
"every Elf with a bow I could find. Finally, I met a Jaqspur, an unerringly "
"accurate long-distance archer. He never spoke a word, but accepted my "
"challenge and split my own arrows mid-flight. He tolerated my company, and "
"we hunted beasts deep in the heart of the woods, stalking creatures that I "
"had never seen nor heard of. I learned how to quiet my mind and slow my "
"breathing, and how to lie in wait unmoving, waiting for the perfect shot, no "
"matter how long it took.\n"
"\n"
"After we parted ways (the Jaqspur was simply gone one morning), I tried in "
"vain to gain passage on ships headed for the Summerset Isles, desperate to "
"discover if High Elves could truly create physical arrows out of nothing but "
"concentrated magicka. I'd heard tales of their potent alchemy, rumors of a "
"potion that can sharpen a man's vision to be like that of an eagle. No ship "
"would have me, though, and I couldn't bribe, beg, or connive my way in.\n"
"\n"
"Undaunted, I continued to the east and into Elsweyr, longing to obtain an "
"authentic Khajiiti shortbow. There are many roaming bands of Khajiit in the "
"northern grasslands, and I've been told since that I was fortunate indeed to "
"encounter a group that found me entertaining instead of just an easy mark. "
"Perhaps I was still a bit green, but it was worth the risk to learn their "
"method of rapid shooting from horseback, and how they craft their barbed "
"arrowheads to puncture even tough leather.\n"
"\n"
"Now, I will set out for Black Marsh, that dread swamp. My Khajiiti "
"companions find my intent to venture there a source of great hilarity, but I "
"won't be turned away. Who knows what the Argonians have learned to do with a "
"bow deep in the bogs? What unique approach might they have? I leave this "
"record with the Khajiit to donate to any bookseller in hopes that someone "
"might draw inspiration or knowledge from my efforts.\n"
"\n"
"My journey is not yet over, though I have been away from home for many years."
" I have learned much since setting out, but most importantly, I have learned "
"that there is far more that I do not know than I ever could have believed."

"\n"
"What do you think of when you hear the phrase \"\"A hero's weapon\"\"? My "
"guess is you don't think of a dagger or call to mind an image of a soldier "
"huddling behind his shield. No, you think of a fine greatsword, gleaming in "
"the sun, slicing through enemies just as easily as it cuts the air and "
"singing against armored foes sent staggering by the force of its strikes. "
"That is a hero's weapon.\n"
"\n"
"I have spent long hours observing the soldiers training in the courtyard "
"below my chambers. It is quite clear to me that the strongest, bravest, "
"smartest, and most handsome of the warriors always choose the greatsword "
"(trust me). It balances brute force with skillful maneuvers, and it is "
"neither as clumsy as a hammer or axe nor as easily broken as a smaller sword "
"or bow. The wielder must have immense strength, but he must also have great "
"agility and insight, knowing when to dodge and how to parry blows. \n"
"\n"
"Of course there are legendary figures who used other weapons, but you'll "
"certainly agree that none inspire the same kind of wonder and awe. When you "
"see someone striding into town covered in heavy armor with a greatsword in "
"tow, you know you're looking at the very face of daring. A greatsword "
"wielder doesn't fear injury; he charges into battle knowing that foes will "
"flee or suffer grave consequences. You might feel a bit faint as they walk "
"by, overwhelmed by such a valiant sight! \n"
"One who wields such a sword shows they embody the hero's approach: to master "
"all aspects of combat. I watch them train their endurance and strength by "
"lifting and running, see them practice moving and dodging. Greatsword "
"wielders train harder than all the other soldiers and are much stronger—that "
"is quite clear.\n"
"\n"
"Not everyone is cut out for heroism, and not every soldier or adventurer "
"will have legends crafted from their deeds. If you aspire to more than just "
"your duty or daily work, and feel the call of battle, then I advise you to "
"set your sights high; aspire to master the greatsword!"

"Recorded by Vothel Bethalas\n"
"\n"
"The following are two tales of the Nord hero Wuunding and his hammer, Tumult."
" Every town I come across seems to have another legend about him, and every "
"Nord I've met swears up and down that they're all true. Their fascination "
"with these exaggerated heroes is charming, in a way, and I've found it an "
"entertaining diversion to set some of the tales to paper, as I've never seen "
"them preserved elsewhere.\n"
"\n"
"Wuunding and the Mountain\n"
"\n"
"Mighty Wuunding desired to pass into the high mountains, for he had heard "
"rumors of a powerful troll lord he wished to fight. The slopes were steep "
"and the snow was thick, and he found it harder and harder to plow his way "
"through. At last, he had enough of digging and struggling. He shouted at the "
"mountain as loud as he could, asking it to shed its snow, but the mountain "
"was stubborn and would not listen. \n"
"\n"
"Frustrated, he cleared the snow from a rock and used Tumult to strike it "
"with all his might. The mountain rumbled with pain, and all the snow rushed "
"past him into the valley so that he could pass. The mountains remember that "
"pain to this day, so you must be careful when shouting at them. Not all can "
"stand against an avalanche.\n"
"\n"
"The Melting of the March\n"
"\n"
"In the old days, a great frozen Daedra made its home in Eastmarch, "
"slaughtering Nords and conjuring an unending blizzard. Like any good Nord, "
"Wuunding hated Daedra, and he sought to free the land and return it to its "
"people. When he tried to venture into the heart of the storm, he found that "
"his body began to freeze, and he was forced to turn back.\n"
"\n"
"As he wandered the edge of the storm, he prayed to Kyne for help. Before "
"long, he came upon a shack where an old woman lived. She invited him in, and "
"upon hearing his tale, she produced a small flask. \"\"This will help you "
"reach the Daedra,\"\" she said, \"\"but do not drink too much at once.\"\" "
"The mead, the sweetest he ever tasted, burned in his belly, and he set off "
"right away, immune to the magical blizzard. \n"
"\n"
"When he found the Daedra at last, they battled all across the land. The "
"magical cold was like nothing he'd faced before, and he felt his strength "
"failing. Without regard to the woman's warning, he downed the whole flask. "
"He burned with a fire so powerful that Tumult roared with flames. The Daedra "
"melted more and more with each strike, leaving steaming pools behind. In the "
"end, nothing was left of the Daedra but the stinking puddles, and Wuunding "
"and Tumult were consumed by the flames. The pools remain even now, a "
"reminder of Wuunding's heroism."

"\n"
"I don't read books much, and there's a good reason. You get all these "
"scholar types philosophizing about anything, even stuff they don't know "
"squat about! The other day, I saw a book about the \"\"art\"\" of the sword. "
"I never saw anything so ridiculous. It was full of \"\"deep thoughts\"\" "
"about how fighting is like dancing and a bunch of other horse piss.\n"
"\n"
"I've seen plenty of fights, and I can tell you that all that high-minded "
"fuss is just going to distract you. Fighting is fighting. It's dirty, it's "
"dangerous, and you do what you have to do to survive. I'll lay it out real "
"simple for you right here, and then you can go smash some skulls in without "
"worrying about dance steps or getting in tune with the soul of the blade or "
"any of that. Here's what you need to know:\n"
"First, find the biggest weapon you can. Something you need to grab with two "
"hands. Forget shields and bows and tiny daggers. Those aren't going to scare "
"your enemy, and that's one of the first things you need to do. Get the "
"hugest hammer you can. A greatsword works, too, I guess. If you can't pick "
"it up and swing it, well, you aren't strong enough to fight, and you're "
"going to need to lift heavy things until you can!\n"
"\n"
"Second, start breaking things with it. Swing it from the side or from over "
"your head, and smash boxes, scarecrows, target dummies—whatever you can find."
" Just get a feel for how it swings. This isn't art. It's about having the "
"scariest weapon and being strong enough and crazy enough to send the enemy "
"fleeing when they see you use it to bash someone's helmet in.\n"
"\n"
"Third, find fights! Join a mercenary band or the military. Do whatever gets "
"you into the action. If you know how to swing your weapon and yell really "
"loud, they'll probably take you, especially if you're big and covered in "
"muscles (you should be). Now you can practice on live targets without "
"getting in trouble. Drink just enough to be angry and then get into the "
"fight. If you're strong enough, your weapon is big enough, and you yell loud "
"enough, you'll win—no reading required."

"Ever put down a tidy sum on a sword only to have the blade fly off as soon "
"as you got it home and gave it a swing? Bet you were mad! You probably "
"stormed back to the market to find the silver-tongued bastard who convinced "
"you it was magical, only to find his stall vacant. \n"
"\n"
"I know this because you bought that weapon from someone just like me. \n"
"\n"
"That's right, I used to pass off the shoddiest merchandise I could get my "
"hands on to folk like you. I'd buy apprentices' failures, find rusted "
"heirlooms at the pawnbroker, and make a profit off people who didn't have "
"much more than big dreams about becoming a hero. Those days are behind me. "
"I've done wrong and want to make amends, so I'm going to arm you with a "
"little knowledge.\n"
"\n"
"The best advice is to buy your weapon from a trusted smith. It may not look "
"like much, but you don't need fancy. I passed off cartloads of giant two-"
"handers on youths with starry eyes, but you'll want to start out with "
"something reasonable—a simple, solid one-hander. A warrior's only as good as "
"his weapon, and you won't learn anything with one that's going to fall apart."
"\n"
"\n"
"If you insist on visiting market stalls, your first goal is to get a weapon "
"in-hand. Never purchase anything without giving a nearby post a few good "
"hacks with it first. If the merchant won't let you handle it and keeps "
"coming up with excuses, he's up to something.\n"
"\n"
"I got good at distracting customers with fancy moves or a sappy yarn. You'd "
"be surprised how easy it is to con someone into a purchase with a tale about "
"how the noble knight's poor widow is just having such a hard time getting by "
"these days, and how, being such a kind-hearted trader, I'm going to take all "
"the profits from his old sword to her anyway—doing an honest deed for a "
"sweet old lady who can't travel to the market on her own.\n"
"\n"
"Don't let this happen to you. Ignore the chatter, get hold of the weapon, "
"and check it for signs of painted-over rust. Examine the hilt or haft with "
"care; look for traces of adhesives where metal contacts other materials. "
"Avoid flashy weapons studded with gems, since you probably can't tell real "
"jewels from glass fakes. The best cons know just a little bit of illusion "
"magic, too, so be skeptical about supposed magical properties, and make sure "
"you examine the item for more than a few minutes. \n"
"\n"
"You should know enough now about what to look for in a good one-hander, and "
"I hope you won't fall for any of these tricks. I'm sorry to anyone I pulled "
"them on in the past, and I wish you the best of luck out in the market and "
"in your training."

"And so it was that day that Saikhalar was in good humor after the morning "

"\"\"You tricked me!\"\" cried Thredor. He stopped short and dropped his axe "

"\n"
"Too often, soldiers neglect one of the most important tools in their arsenal:"
" the dagger. That's right, the humble boot-knife, the weapon favored by "
"thieves and, yes, even assassins. It's easy to see why the short blade has a "
"poor reputation among those who dream of charging into battle to gain glory "
"by lopping off heads with a greatsword, but it can save you in a pinch.\n"
"\n"
"The well-rounded soldier is prepared for any situation, and that means "
"familiarity with weapons large and small. A dagger can be your best friend—a "
"concealed blade can cut your bonds free in the event of capture, it can give "
"you a fighting chance should you become disarmed, it can skin a quick meal "
"on the trail, and practicing with one can teach you volumes about mobility "
"and close combat. \n"
"\n"
"If you want to be fully prepared for the battlefield, you'll practice these "
"simple exercises at least once a week. Listen to my advice, and you'll "
"improve your survivability tenfold.\n"
"\n"
"The Quick Draw: Strap a few small daggers where you can reach them easily. "
"You might want one strapped to your thigh, one near your sword, or one at "
"your shoulder. All you're going to do is draw them and bring them to the "
"ready as fast as you can. Seems simple, but you need to master this step. If "
"you can't get to them fast, you're as good as dead.\n"
"\n"
"Target Practice: Bows are fine weapons, but what happens when you run out of "
"arrows and the foe is charging in? Practice some throws at the archery "
"range, keeping your wrist stiff and making sure to follow through, releasing "
"the hilt when it aligns with the target. This is especially useful when "
"coupled with the Quick Draw exercise.\n"
"\n"
"The Reed: You'll need a partner with a practice weapon for this one. Keep a "
"hand behind your back, hold your dagger in the other, and have them charge "
"you with their best attacks. Your goal is to keep your feet planted and bend "
"out of the way quickly. Don't back up; try to end up on the inside of the "
"attack, where your dagger can be deadly.\n"
"\n"
"What are you waiting for? Get out there are spend some time with your "
"dagger—you can thank me when it saves your life."

"The traditional approach for a novice alchemist to learn how to concoct "

"Today's lesson is about the leathers and tannins used by clothiers when "
"making medium armor. As you have noticed while hiding from the nightwatch in "
"your father's armory, medium leathers come in many kinds: for example, "
"brigantines are hard and studded, while running leathers are tough but "
"flexible. These different styles are achieved by the use of different hides "
"and tannins. \n"
"\n"
"Tannins are the \"\"tempers\"\" used by the crafter to balance hardness and "
"resiliency in medium armor. A leather chestpiece can be treated to be as "
"rigid as a board, able to turn an assassin's knife—but if it is too rigid, "
"the wearer is unable to turn his or her body. Thus, armorers use tannins on "
"leathers and fabrics to strike a balance between stiffness and flexibility.\n"
"\n"
"What does this have to do with the look of the resulting armor set? If only "
"you had asked that question at lessons rather than daydreaming about "
"impressing the scullery maid with that wisp of a mustache. It has everything "
"to do with it, as you'll see for yourself. Now get to work on curing those "

"My dear Exchequer,\n"
"\n"
"I once again implore you to revisit the levy that has been placed upon "
"myself for this year. I admit that I am a licensed enchanter residing inside "
"the Imperial City. But circumstances have changed, and the business that was "
"once profitable, is now just a drain on my income. \n"
"\n"
"A few years ago, enchanters would take the physical object to be enchanted "
"and, using various ingredients and tools, imbue the object with the "
"necessary mystical powers. Because of this, enchanters only competed with "
"other enchanters who resided in the same city, since most people did not "
"want to carry a sword hundreds of leagues to another enchanter just to save "
"a few gold drakes. Prices for the city could be set at a friendly meeting of "
"three or four enchanters, and a fine profit could be made. As the right of "
"the crown, a hefty levy for allowing us to operate in the city could be "
"assessed.\n"
"\n"
"But now this has all changed. Enchanters now just make a glyph with the "
"desired effect trapped within it. A glyph is just a simple gem that anyone "
"can attach to the pommel of a sword or on a piece of armor. Once attached "
"the magic in the glyph then flows into the item. \n"
"\n"
"Seems simple, doesn't it? Well, this has caused a collapse of the market. "
"Instead of the price for an enchantment being set on a city-by-city basis, "
"all of the enchanters of Tamriel have to compete with each other. A hedge "
"enchanter in Daggerfall can make ten fire glyphs and sell them to a "
"traveling merchant, who brings them to the Imperial City and sells them in "
"the marketplace, at a price much below the price set by the Cyrodilic "
"enchanters. \n"
"\n"
"All this competition means that I now make just a few gold over the cost my "
"materials. And this profit does not cover the levy your office places on me.\n"
"\n"
"Unless your office stops the importation of foreign manufactured glyphs, you "
"must reduce the levy to allow me to stay in business. I will be forced to "
"sell my home of twenty years and take up another profession, perhaps "
"tutoring some merchant's son. \n"

"the howling of the desert winds.\n"
"\n"
"Mercenaries, swathed in chain and boiled leather, cursed the sweltering heat "
"that broiled them under the unblinking sun.\n"
"\n"
"Hearing their muttered oaths, Ehtelar was thankful for Rahad, her trusted "

"\n"
"\"\"Dress lightly,\"\" he'd said,\"\"Loosely woven tunics will be your "

"\n"
"Trundling forward, the wagon train crested a windswept ridge and came to a "

"\n"
"Curious, Ehtelar dismounted. As she made her way toward the front of the "
"train, merchants confused by the sudden stop peered out from the awnings "
"that kept the sun from their backs.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"My friend,\"\" Rahad said as she passed the head carriage, \"\"Your "
"travels have taken you to many shores, but tell me: Have you ever "
"encountered such a sight?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"As he spoke, he gestured out past the road to the valley below. There, amid "
"burnt stone and winding trails, great alabaster spires protruded from the "
"sand like arrows fallen into thick sod, stretching for miles in the space "
"between the ridge and its twin across the span.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"What is it?\"\" she asked, regaining her composure.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I was hoping you could tell me,\"\" he replied, \"\"This pass is "
"normally home to nothing but sand heaped in dunes for miles. Who can say how "
"long that was buried here?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Realizing an opportunity to make a profit, Ehtelar insisted they camp among "
"the ruins for the night. The mercenaries, glad for a reprieve from the "
"noonday sun, were all too happy for a break from their grueling trek.\n"
"\n"
"Night fell and their carousing was heard into the early hours of the morning."
" If there were anything untoward about the ruins around them, it went "
"unnoticed in the din.\n"
"\n"
"Dawn found Ehtelar and her companion picking a path through the spires in "
"search of an entrance. It was almost noon before they found one.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Here!\"\" Rahad cried out, excitement barely concealed beneath the deep "
"timbre of his voice, \"\"I found a way through!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Running now, to reach her friend and see what he had found, Ehtelar rounded "
"a bend in the stone. As she did, she was greeted by a terrible sight.\n"
"\n"
"Hanging limp from a great spear thrust out from the crack was Rahad. His "
"scabbard was empty, the sword that filled it thrust into a nearby dune.\n"
"\n"
"She stood there, gaping in horror, as Rahad was lifted into the air, a great "
"scaly head emerging from the sand heaped in piles about the ruined doorway. "
"With one fluid motion the creature shifted its weight, throwing Rahad to one "
"side as it began to clean the gore from its weapon.\n"
"\n"
"Ehtelar shook her head in disbelief. She thought to call out, but realized "
"the creature would probably kill her before she issued a second syllable. "
"Slowly, carefully, she took a step back, then another. For a moment it "
"seemed she would escape, but as her third step met ground, the creature "
"turned.\n"
"\n"
"Dodging back from a thrust spearpoint, Ehtelar found her ears deafened by a "
"sudden burst of shrill music. Clapping her hands over them defensively, she "
"stumbled back as her adversary uncoiled before her.\n"
"\n"
"Rising, expanding its ribs until it had nearly doubled in size, its "
"multitonal voice joined itself in chorus. Its shrieking harmony resounded "
"through the sand until tiny grains fell away from the ruins in sheets. As it "
"shifted, the stone beneath her collapsed, spilling her out toward her foe.\n"
"\n"
"It was all she could do to grab Rahad's sword, buried to the pommel in sand. "
"Suddenly within striking distance, she thrust the sword through the fiend's "
"blackened maw. As steel met skull, the terrible crescendo of its voice began "
"to falter.\n"
"\n"
"In that moment, her opponent realized a simple truth: It no longer hungered "
"for blood and flesh. It no longer wanted much of anything at all. \"\"How "
"wonderful!\"\" it thought as the ground rushed up to meet it. If its "
"reptilian mouth allowed, it would have smiled.\n"
"\n"
"As the lamia spiraled to the ground, its hooked spear caught Ehtelar in the "
"calf. Feeling the cold bite of steel, she was thrown off balance. For a "
"moment it seemed she would right herself, but the stone she stood upon "
"suddenly gave way.\n"
"\n"
"Down into the dark she fell, suspended within a cloud of sand that swept "
"past the jutting stones and crenelated spires peering out from the shadows "
"below. \n"
"\n"
"As the bright, desert sky abandoned her, she found herself bathed in "
"scintillating light. A field of stars sparkled around her—not stars, for "
"they were far underground. They were the bright crystals of the Ayleidoon.\n"
"\n"
"She fell for what seemed like days, her only company the flickering lights "
"careening up at her from the darkness. \"\"If I could only grasp one of "
"those tiny stars,\"\" she thought, her hands reaching toward them, \"\"I "
"might become as ethereal as they are and leave this world behind.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"From below, a whisper grew to a rustling, wind like sound. Looking down, it "
"seemed her flight of stars came to a hard edge—rushing up at her in the dark."

"During the Skyrim Conquests (1E 240—415), ambitious Highland earls, envious "
"of the conquests and wealth of their northern cousins in High Rock and "
"Morrowind, looked south over the ramparts of the Jerall Mountains for their "
"opportunities. The Jerall Mountains proved to be too great a barrier, and "
"northern Cyrodiil too poor a prize, to reward full scale Nord invasions. "
"However, Alessia hired many ambitious Nord and Breton warbands as "
"mercenaries with the promises of rich lands and trade concessions. Once "
"settled among the victorious Alessian Cyrodiils, the Nord and Breton "
"warriors and battlemages were quickly assimilated into the comfortable and "
"prosperous Nibenese culture.\n"
" \n"
"Alessia received the divine inspiration for her Slave Rebellion at Sancre "
"Tor, and here she founded her holy city. Sancre Tor's mines provided some "
"wealth, but the poor soils and harsh climate of the remote mountain site "
"meant it must be supplied with food and goods from the Heartlands. Further, "
"located on one of the few passes through the Jeralls, its fortunes were "
"subject to the instability of relations with Skyrim. When relations were "
"good with Skyrim, it prospered through trade and alliance. When relations "
"were bad with Skyrim, it was vulnerable to siege and occupation by the Nords."
"\n"
" \n"
"With the decline of the Alessian Order (circa 1E 2321), the seat of "
"religious rule of Cyrodiil moved south to the Imperial City, but Sancre Tor "
"remained a mountain fortress and major religious center. Alessian historians "
"asserted that Sancre Tor was magically concealed and defended by the gods. "
"Records of Sancre Tor's repeated defeats and occupations by northern "
"invaders give the lie to this assertion. The entrance to the citadel was "
"indeed concealed by sorcery, and the citadel and its labyrinthine "
"subterranean complex were defended by magical traps and illusions, but their "
"secrets were betrayed to besieging Nords by the Breton enchanters who "
"crafted them.\n"
" \n"
"One enduring feature of the legend of Sancre Tor is the ancient tombs of the "
"Reman emperors. Following the defeat of the first Akaviri invaders, Sancre "
"Tor enjoyed a brief resurgence of wealth and culture under Reman Cyrodiil "
"and his descendants, Reman II and Reman III. Tracing his ancestry to St. "
"Alessia, and following the tradition that St. Alessia was buried in the "
"catacombs beneath Sancre Tor, Reman built splendid funerary precincts in the "
"depths of the ancient citadel underpassages. Here the last Reman emperor, "
"Reman III, was buried in his tomb with the Amulet of Kings.\n"
" \n"
"Sancre Tor has lain in ruins since the middle of the Second Age, and the "
"surrounding region is virtually uninhabited. Now all communications with the "
"north are through the passes at Chorrol and Bruma, and Sancre Tor's citadel "
"and underpassages have become the refuge of various savage Goblin tribes.\n"

"So, you want to make it as a cutpurse. You want to live the life of a "
"criminal, always one step ahead of everyone and pockets brimming with gold "
"drakes. Maybe it appeals to you to try and earn a living by robbing some "
"wealthy merchants or extorting your local shopkeepers? Let me give you a bit "
"of advice—don't bother. For every skilled thief I've met in my day, I've "
"seen a twenty who thought that they had what it took but ended up rotting in "
"jail.\n"
" \n"
"But if you're anything like me, you don't listen to advice. You do whatever "
"you want and never let anyone else tell you otherwise. To Oblivion with the "
"risks—all that matters is the coin. Sound familiar? If it does, then this "
"book might just teach you the difference between acting like a petty thief "
"and a master criminal.\n"
" \n"
"I know what you're thinking. Who's this Wulfmare? Who does he think he is, "
"telling me how to be a better thief? What makes him an expert? Simple. Maybe "
"you heard about that heist in Mournhold, when the Archcanon's sacred diamond "
"ring went missing? Or perhaps the tale of an Elder Scroll gone missing from "
"the White-Gold Tower reached your ears. That's right … it was yours truly. "
"I've done just about every kind of job you can imagine and I've got the "
"drakes put away to prove it. How else could an ex-thief find the resources "
"to publish his own book?\n"
" \n"
"Now that I have your attention, let's start with two of the most fundamental "
"skills you'll need to sharpen if you want to make it as a cutpurse: picking "
"locks and picking pockets. And before you roll your eyes and throw this book "
"aside in disgust, I can promise you that the easiest way you're going to get "
"caught is by ignoring the basics—but if you can master these activities "
"you'll find yourself swimming in coin.\n"
" \n"
"Picking pockets is one of the easiest skills to learn, but you'd be "
"surprised how often I've seen novice thieves muck it up. The lesson here is "
"twofold. First, know your surroundings, and second, know your approach. "
"Where and when you decide to go fishing is just as important as who you "
"choose as your mark. Follow them a while, there's never a need to rush. Wait "
"until they're somewhere isolated and out of earshot of any guards—but most "
"importantly always know when to let the mark go. Getting pinched simply "
"isn't worth the risk. There'll always be plenty of other marks who'll come "
"along with their pockets full. \n"
"\n"
"As far as the approach goes, don't drop into your crouch until you are "
"completely out of the mark's view—directly behind and preferably close to "
"them. Don't spend too long deciding what you'll lift either. A good thief "
"should be able to hit a mark and make off with something valuable in less "
"than five seconds. Last of all, plying this trade at night will greatly "
"reduce your chances of getting caught. If you have no other choice and you "
"have to do it in the daylight, just make sure you aren't out in the open.\n"
" \n"
"Lockpicking is an art form that takes years to master. The important thing "
"to remember is that no two are alike, each one behaving completely "
"differently. As long as you keep your wits about you, and your patience, "
"you'll find them easier to defeat than you'd initially expect. \n"
"\n"
"Good picks are always essential. Make sure you have plenty of them tucked "
"away in your pockets. Always take your time and keep a light touch on the "
"picks. When the tumblers begin to fall into place, you should feel the pick "
"tremble ever-so-slightly—this means you're near the sweet spot. Slow down at "
"that point and only move the picks with the finest touch. If you blindly "
"poke at the lock like an old man, all you're going to end up with is a bunch "
"of broken picks and equally broken pride. As a last resort, if the lock is "
"completely confounding you, there's always the option of smashing it. Just "
"keep in mind that this is rarely successful and could potentially make a "
"great deal of noise.\n"
" \n"
"By using my techniques, I'm not merely suggesting you'll be a successful "
"thief, I'm giving you a solid guarantee. All it takes is a little bit of "
"patience and a great deal of practice then maybe, just maybe, you'll become "
"as successful as Wulfmare.\n"
" \n"
"In my next volume, we'll move onto another important tool in your "
"arsenal—sneaking. I'll prove to you that the shadows can be just as potent "
"of a weapon as your blade if you know how to bend them to your will."

"Like all true heroes, Rislav Larich had inauspicious beginnings. We are told "
"by chroniclers that the springtide night in the 448th year of the First Era "
"on which he was born was unseasonably cold, and that his mother Queen Lynada "
"died very shortly after setting eyes upon her son. If he were much beloved "
"of his father, King Mhorus of Skingrad, who already had plenty of heirs, "
"three sons and four daughters before him, the chroniclers make no mention of "
"it.\n"
" \n"
"His existence was so very undistinguished that we hear virtually nothing of "
"him for the first twenty years of his life. His schooling, we can suppose, "
"was similar to that of any \"\"spare prince\"\" in the Colovian West, with "
"Ayleid tutors to teach him the ways of hunting and battle. Etiquette, "
"religious instruction, and even basic statecraft were seldom a part of the "

"son Hoag were in attendance. And despite the Empire's intolerance of all "
"Elves, Chimer Indoril Nerevar and Dwemer Dumac Dwarfking were evidently "
"there as well, diplomatically representing Resdayn, all in relative peace.\n"
" \n"
"Also mentioned on the rolls was a young mer in service to the Imperial court "
"of High Rock, who was to have a great history with Rislav. Ryan Direnni.\n"
"\n"
"Whether the two young men of about the same age met and conversed is "
"entirely the stuff of historian's fancy. Ryan is spoken of in praising words "
"as a powerful land-owner, eventually buying the island of Balfiera in the "
"Iliac Bay and gradually conquering all of High Rock and large parts of "
"Hammerfell and Skyrim, but Rislav is not heard of again in history's books "
"for another seventeen years. We can only offer supposition based on the "
"facts that follow.\n"
"\n"
"Children of kings are, of course, married to the children of other kings to "
"bind alliances. The kingdoms of Skingrad and Kvatch skirmished over common "
"territory throughout the fifth century, until they reached a peace in the "
"year 472. The details of this accord are not recorded, but since we know "
"that Prince Rislav was in the court of Kvatch six years later, as husband to "
"Belene, the daughter of King Justinius, it is fair to make an educated guess "
"that they were married then to make peace.\n"
" \n"
"This brings us to the year 478, when a great plague swept through all of "
"Cyrodiil and seemed particularly concentrated in the independent Colovian "
"West. Among the victims were King Mhorus and the rest of the entire royal "
"family in Skingrad. Rislav's only surviving elder brother, Dorald, survived, "
"being in the Imperial City as a priest of Maruhk. He returned to his "
"homeland to assume the throne.\n"
" \n"
"Of Dorald, we have some history. The King's second son, he was slightly "
"simple-minded and evidently very pious. All the chroniclers spoke of his "
"sweetness and decency, how he saw a vision in his early years that brought "
"him—with his father's blessing—from Skingrad to the Imperial City and the "
"priesthood. The priesthood of Maruhk, of course, saw no difference between "
"spiritual and political matters. It was the religion of the Alessian Empire, "
"and it taught that to resist the Emperor was to resist the Gods. Given that, "
"it is scarcely a surprise what Dorald did when he became King of the "
"independent kingdom of Skingrad.\n"
" \n"
"His first edict, on his very first day, was to cede the kingdom to the "
"Empire.\n"
" \n"
"The reaction throughout the Colovian Estates was shock and outrage, nowhere "
"more so than in the court of Kvatch. Rislav Larich, we are told, rode forth "
"to his brother's kingdom, together with his wife and two dozen of his father-"
"in-law's cavalry. It was surely not an impressive army, no matter how the "
"chroniclers embellish it, but they had little trouble defeating all the "
"guards Dorald sent to stop them. In truth, there was no actual battling, for "
"the soldiers of Skingrad resented their new king's decision to give up their "
"autonomy.\n"
"\n"
"The brothers faced one another in the castle courtyard where they had grown "
"up.\n"
" \n"
"In typical Colovian fashion, there was no trial, no accusations of treason, "
"no jury, no judge. Only an executioner.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Thou art no brother of mine,\"\" Rislav Larich said, and struck Dorald's "
"head from his shoulders in one blow. He was crowned King of Skingrad still "
"holding the same bloody axe in his arms."

"맹위를 떨치고 있던 때로, 그의 모친 리네이다 여왕은 자신이 낳은 아이를 보지 못하고 일찍 죽었다. 3명의 아들과 4명의 딸을 둔 "
"스킨그라드의 모라스 왕이 그를 많이 아꼈는지는 몰라도 연대기 집필자들은 그에 대해 별도의 언급이 없다.\n"
"\n"
"그의 존재는 눈에 띄지 않았기 때문에, 우리는 그의 인생 첫 20년에 대해서는 거의 기록이 남아있지 않다. 그의 교육에 대해 말하자면, "
"콜로비안 서부지역의 '예비 왕자'가 모두 그랬던 것처럼, 알레이드의 교관들이 사냥과 전투기술을 가르치고 있었을 것이라는 정도의 상상을 "
"해볼 수 있다. 문명이 태동하고 있던 니베나이 계곡과는 달리 예의범절, 종교적 가르침, 정치의 기본조차도 콜로비안 대지의 왕자교육에는 "
"거의 포함되지 않고 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"제1기 461년, 2월 (Sun's Dawn) 23일에 행해진 고리에우스 황제 대관식의 참가자 명부에 그의 가족과 함께 그에 대해 간략한 "
"언급이 있다. 물론 그 행사는 알레시아 마루크 독트린 시대에 이루어져 오락적인 면은 전혀 없었지만, 어쨌든 이때 13세의 리슬라브는 가장 "
"위대한 전설적인 인물들을 몇명 목격할 수 있었을 것이다. 아네퀴나의 야수 달록 브레이가 왕국을 대표하여, 황제에 경의를 표시했다. "
"스카이림의 영주 백왕 크조릭과 아들 호그도 참석했으며, 모든 엘프족에 대해 제국은 너그럽지 않았음에도 불구하고, 카이머인 인도릴 네레바와 "
"드워프의 왕 듀막도 조용히 레스데인의 외교대표로써 참석하고 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"그 외에도 후에 리슬라브와 함께 커다란 역사를 쌓아 올리게 될 하이락 제국 궁중출신의 젊은 엘프도 언급되고 있다. 그가 바로 리안 "
"디레니이다.\n"
"\n"
"거의 같은 나이인 두 명의 젊은이가 그 자리에서 만나 이야기를 했는지에 관해서는, 온전히 역사가의 상상에 맡길 수 밖에 없다. 최종적으로 "
"일리악 만의 발피에라 섬을 매입하고 하이락 전역과 해머펠, 스카이림을 점점 잠식한 대지주로서의 리안에 대해서는 칭찬으로 기술되어져 "
"있지만, 그에 반해 리슬라브의 이름은 17년간, 역사서에 일절 등장하고 있지 않다. 우리는 그래서 전해지는 사실을 바탕으로 추측할 수 "
"밖에 없다.\n"
"\n"
"왕가의 자손이라는 것은, 다들 알고 있겠지만, 동맹을 맺는 것을 목적으로 다른 왕가 자손들과 결혼하는 것을 최우선으로 한다. 5세기에 "
"이르러 스킨그라드와 크바치 왕국은 서로의 영토를 침범하면서 소규모 전투를 반복하고 있었으며, 간신히 평화협정에 이른 것은 472년의 "
"일이었다. 이 협정에 관한 자세한 것은 기록되어 있지 않지만, 6년 후 저스티니어스 왕의 딸 베렌의 남편으로서 리슬라브 왕자가 크바치 "
"궁중에 있던 것은 사실이기에, 평화를 목적으로 두 사람이 결혼했다고 생각하는 것은 근거있는 추측이라고 말할 수 있을 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"이것을 계기로, 우리들은 시로딜 전역, 특히 콜로비안 서부 독립국에서 전염병이 맹위를 떨치고 있던 478년에 관심을 가지게 된다. 희생자 "
"중에는 모라스 왕과 스킨그라드 왕족 전원이 포함되어 있다. 리슬라브의 형으로써 유일하게 살아남은 드랄드는 마라의 성직자로 제국의 수도에 "
"머물러 있던 덕분에 목숨을 건질 수 있었다. 그는 그 후 왕위를 잇기 위해 고국으로 돌아오게 된다.\n"
"\n"
"드랄드에 관해서는 약간의 역사기록이 있다. 왕의 차남인 그는 호인인 것과 동시에 매우 믿음직스런 남자이기도 한 것 같다. 연대기 편집자는 "
"빠짐없이 그 사람의 좋은 점과 함께, 어릴 적에 신탁일을 본 것을 계기로 -부친의 동의를 얻어- 스킨그라드에서  제국의 수도로 옮겨 "
"성직에 종사한 경위에 대해서 적고 있다. 물론 마루크의 성직자에게 있어서는 종교적인 일과 정치적인 일의 차이는 거의 없다. 그것이 "
"알레시아 제국의 종교이며, 황제를 거스르는 것은 신을 거스르는 것과 같다고 가르쳤다. 이러한 상황을 종합적으로 볼때, 드랄드가 스킨그라드 "
"독립국의 왕이 된다고 해도 전혀 놀랄 일은 아니었다.\n"
"\n"
"그의 첫 포고는 왕국을 제국에 양도한다고 하는 것이었다.\n"
"\n"
"그러한 포고에 대한 반응으로 콜로비아의 영토 전역에 충격과 분노가 가득 찼다. 다른 곳보다 더 심한 타격을 받은 것은 크바치의 왕족이었다."
" 리슬라브 라리치는 아내 및 아버지의 부하인 24명의 기병대를 거느리고 형의 왕국으로 향했다고 전해지고 있다. 연대기 편집자가 얼마나 "
"꾸몄는지는 몰라도 군대로서 형편없는 것은 분명하다. 그러나 그것을 저지하려고 드랄드가 파견한 군대들을 돌파하는데 고생할 필요는 없었고, "
"실제로는 변변한 전투조차 없었다고 한다. 스킨그라드의 병사들도 자치권을 포기한다는 새로운 왕의 결정에 분개하고 있었기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"마침내 형제는 그들이 자란 성의 뜰에서 서로 마주쳤다.\n"
"\n"
"전형적인 콜로비안의 방식에 따른다면 재판도 없고, 반역죄고발도 없고, 배심원이나 재판관도 없다. 오직 사형집행인만 있을 뿐이다.\n"
"\n"
"\\\\\"\\\\\"그대는 내 형이 아니다\\\\\"\\\\\" 리슬라브 라리치는 그렇게 말하고, 일격으로 드랄드의 목을 내리쳤다. "
"피투성이의 도끼를 양손에 잡은 채, 그는 스킨그라드 왕관을 수여받았다.\n"
