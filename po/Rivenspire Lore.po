"\n"
"One would surmise that such an elusive and ancient noble house would be "
"averse to publishing its goals in such an accessible manner. However, with "
"the advent of strife upon our homes and allies, I thought it best to clarify "
"our standing for the small-minded.\n"
"\n"
"The first and foremost goal of House Ravenwatch is the destruction of the "
"ancient evil which lies within Rivenspire. It is known by many names: "
"Abagandra, Loradabal, and in contemporary times, the Lightless Remnant. "
"Countless generations of scholars have sought to understand this artifact. "
"There is no understanding to be had—it is a blight upon Mundus and must be "
"cast out.\n"
"\n"
"Secondly, House Ravenwatch seeks to foil the plans of those who wish to make "
"use of the power of the Lightless Remnant. Do not be deceived by Baron "
"Montclair's rhetoric and so-called patriotic zeal. He has succumbed to the "
"power of the Remnant and seeks to destroy the beautiful land of Rivenspire. "
"We know this because we were with him when the power possessed him.\n"
"\n"
"We prefer the shadows. We prefer to let others lead. But these are desperate "
"times. They call for desperate measures. Know that no matter what Rivenspire "
"must face, you will not face it alone. House Ravenwatch will be by your side."
" House Ravenwatch stands with Emeric and the good people of Rivenspire.\n"

"This report on the city of Northpoint and its primary noble house, Dorell, "
"was ordered directly by His Majesty High King Emeric and has been "
"painstakingly researched. I, Chancellor Regina Troivois of the Department of "
"Interior Affairs, personally oversaw this effort and verify the accuracy of "
"the information contained herein.\n"
"\n"
"First, some history for context. Captain Yric Flowdys, an enterprising "
"Breton trader operating the summer route of shipping from Daggerfall to "
"Solitude, established Northpoint during the 9th century of the First Era. "
"Though the shores here do not form an ideal harbor, Yric knew the deep "
"waters approaching them could easily accommodate large vessels, and that the "
"location along the trade route made for a perfect way station where traders "
"could resupply, make repairs, or shelter through storms. He constructed the "
"first docks at Northpoint, the best anchorage, and named the port after it.\n"
"\n"
"Soon after building the docks, Captain Flowdys oversaw the addition of a "
"small walled keep and warehouse in the heights of Dore Elard, to the east of "
"the growing port-of-call. Before long, the town bustled with activity, and "
"Flowdys, realizing the success of his venture, took the name of the mountain "
"as his new family name. He and his relatives continued to grow their "
"maritime endeavors, as well as develop and invest in the port and "
"surrounding lands, eventually leasing plots to farmers and establishing new "
"sources of income. \n"
"\n"
"For most of the First Era, the family exemplified the type of active, "
"entrepreneurial merchant princes that brought great prosperity to High Rock. "
"In 1E 1029, the Dorells were granted a barony when the Empress Hestra joined "
"High Rock to the First Empire. The fortunes of House Dorell, and of "
"Northpoint, have waxed and waned with the flow of the northwest coastal "
"trade ever since.\n"
"\n"
"In the 24th century the Dorells, having continued their rise in wealth and "
"power, held the monarchy of Shornhelm for several generations. This "
"distinction has colored the family's image of itself through subsequent "
"centuries, and the Dorells regard themselves among Rivenspire's true elite "
"even today. It also gave them a taste for political intrigue which, combined "
"with their already-ambitious spirit, has made the house impossible to ignore."
" The current Baron of the House, Alard, wields significant power as one of "
"the triumvirate of nobles who have ruled Rivenspire since the fall of Ranser."
" Along with the leaders of House Montclair and House Tamrith, Alard Dorell "
"has pledged himself to the High King and hopes to one day earn the right to "
"rule as the sole King of Shornhelm.\n"
"\n"
"In recent times, House Dorell excels as a maritime and mercantile power. "
"They maintain a mansion in Shornhelm for the Baron and Baroness, keeping the "
"house closely involved in the happenings of the court. The estate in "
"Northpoint is left to other relatives, though oversight of its lands remains "
"integral to the family's operations. At present the young but very capable "
"Lord Ellic, son of Baron Alard, manages the family's holdings around "
"Northpoint when his father is at court and serving on the triumverate.\n"
"\n"
"The Dorells are militaristic and politically savvy, and their mercantile "
"traditions have forged a level of wealth rarely seen in Rivenspire circles. "
"House Dorell has generated extensive ties with merchants in Solitude. This, "
"they are quick to point out, has nothing to do with the sword rattling of "
"politics. To Dorell, this is simply good business.\n"
"\n"
"From my study of the three noble houses of Rivenspire that form the ruling "
"triumvirate, I recommend that you place little trust in House Montclair, and "
"to be cautious in any interaction with them—their true loyalties are only to "
"their own aspirations. House Dorell, on the other hand, while also "
"ambitious, seems to possess a degree of honor and a love of country rarely "
"exhibited by the Montclairs (who seem to be overly proud of their heritage "
"to Ranser). House Tamrith, meanwhile, has always been loyal and a friend to "
"Wayrest. However, the Countess is relatively new to her role as house leader "
"and may not be ready to assume any greater responsibilities"

"에머릭(Emeric) 께서 지시하신 바에 의해 면밀히 조사되었다. 나, 내무부장인 레지나 트로이보이스(Regina Troivois)가 "
"이를 감독하였고 이 보고서에 쓰인 정보의 정확성을 입증한다.\n"
"\n"
"우선, 맥락을 위해 역사에 대해 기술한다. 대거폴(Daggerfall)에서 솔리튜드(Solitude)로 향하는 여름 화물을 감독했던 "
"진취적인 브레튼 무역가 이릭 플로디스 대장(Yric Flowdys)이 첫 시대(First Era) 9세기 경 "
"노스포인트(Northpoint) 를 세운다. 이곳의 해안은 항구로써 꼴을 갖추고있지 않았지만, 이릭은 다가오는 깊은 물로 인해 이곳이 "
"거대 함선을 수용하고 무역로의 중간 교두보로써 상인들이 재보급을 하며, 수리와 폭풍을 피해 안식을 취할 수 있는 장소가 될 수 있음을 "
"알았다.  이릭은 노스포인트에 최초이자 최고의 정박지를 만들었고, 이에 항구의 이름을 따 지었다.\n"
"\n"
"항구를 짓고 얼마 후, 플로디스 대장은 자라나는 기항지 동쪽으로 있는 도어 엘라드(Dore Elard) 언덕에 있는 작은 성벽 요새와 "
"창고를 경영하게 된다. 머지 않아, 마을은 활기 차게 북적이고 플로디스는 자신의 모험이 성공했음을 알아 산의 이름을 자신의 성으로 따 "
"삼는다. 플로디스와 그 가족은 바다에 투자하는 만큼 항구와 주변 땅에도 노력을 기울여 농부들에게 땅을 임대해 새로운 수익의 원천으로 "
"만든다.\n"
"\n"
"첫 시대 걸쳐, 플로디스의 가문은 하이 락(High Rock)에 크나큰 번영을 가져온 활동적이고 기업가정신 투철한 상인 귀족의 전형으로써 "
"인정받는다. 1E 1029가 되자, 헤스트라(Hestra) 여제가 첫 제국(First Empire)에 하이 락을 편입시키면서 도렐 가문은 "
"남작 위를 수여받게 된다. 도렐 가문과 노스포인트의 자산은 북서쪽 연안의 무역의 흐름 따라 흥망성쇠를 반복한다.\n"
"\n"
"24세기 경 도렐 가문은 계속해서 부와 권력을 모아, 몇 세대 동안 숀헬름(Shornhelm)의 군주 위치를 지킨다. 이 차이로 인해 "
"도렐 가문은 차후 몇 세기 동안 스스로에 대한 이미지를 굳힌다. 오늘 날까지도 스스로를 리븐스피어의 진정한 특권계층으로 인식하고 있는 "
"것이다. 이 이미지로 인해 도렐 가문은 정치적 음모에도 일가견이 생겨, 그 야망 가득한 정신과 함께 스스로를 무시할 수 없는 위치로 "
"끌어올렸다. 현 가문의 남작인 알라드(Alard)는 랜서(Ranser) 왕의 몰락 이후 리븐스피어를 다스리고 있는 삼대 귀족 중 하나로써 "
"엄청난 권력을 휘두르고 있다. 몽클레어(Montclair) 가문과 탐리스(Tamrith) 가문과 함께, 알라드 도렐은 하이 킹에게 충성을 "
"맹세하고 언젠가 숀헬름의 유일한 왕 자리를 노리고있다.\n"
"\n"
"최근, 도렐 가문은 바다와 무역에서 권력을 과시하고 있다.  숀헬름에서 남작 부부를 위한 대저택을 세우고, 그 저택에서 대소사를 처리한다."
" 노스포인트의 사유지는 다른 친척들의 손에 들어갔다. 토지 관리에 대한 권리는 가문에서 관리하긴 하지만. 현재 알라드 남작의 아들, "
"젊지만 유능한 엘릭(Ellic) 경이 아버지가 리븐스피어를 다스리는 동안 노스포인트 근방 가문의 영지를 관리하고있다.\n"
"\n"
"도렐 가문은 군국주의적이며 정치적으로 약삭 빠르다. 또한 이들의 상업적 전통이 빚어낸 부의 크기는 리븐스피어 내에서도 비교 할 상대가 "
"거의 없다. 도렐 가문은 솔리튜드의 상인들과 커다란 유대를 형성했다. 여기에서 도렐 가문은 소위 말하자면 정치적인 드잡이질과 아무런 "
"연관이 없다. 도렐 가문에게 있어, 솔리튜드의 상인들은 단순히 좋은 사업 상대인 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"리븐스피어를 다스리는 3대 귀족 가문에 대한 내 연구를 볼때, 몽클레어 가문은 믿지 말고 교류가 있을 땐 주의를 기울일 것을 추천한다. "
"이들은 진정으로 충성을 보이고 있지 않다. 랜서 왕의 적통이라는 자부심을 지나치게 안고 있는 몽클레어 가문에 비해, 도렐 가문은 "
"야심적이지만 명예를 알고 애국심이 있는 것으로 보인다. 탐리스 가문은 언제나 웨이레스트에 충성하며 웨이레스트의 친구였다. 그러나 탐리스의 "
"백작은 비교적 신참인 데다가 가주의 위치에서 중대사를 책임지기엔 아직 부족해 보인다."

"By Lord Wylon, 39th Baron Montclair\n"
"\n"
"The Breton people of the Markwasten Moor and Shornhelm heights have a long "
"and storied history, with much to be proud of: the Trammeling of the Giants "
"in the time of legends; the Purge of the Wyrd-Hags in the Year of Sun's-"
"Death (which restored Magnus to the skies of the Mundus); and the Charge of "
"the Montclair Knights (often erroneously referred to as the Charge of the "
"Shornhelm Knights) at the Battle of Glenumbria Moors. \n"
"\n"
"Through all this tumultuous history, the people of Rivenspire are fortunate "
"to have been ably led, through times of terror and triumph, by the noble "
"lords of the House of Montclair. \n"
"\n"
"It is true that the Barons of House Montclair have not always been selected "
"by fate to also reign as King of Shornhelm. But the Montclairs count "
"humility among their many virtues, and have often been willing to defer to "
"pretenders with weaker claims to royalty in the interest of peace. That this "
"humility has sometimes been tragically over-indulged was sadly proven in the "
"case of my father—Phylgeon, 38th Baron Montclair. \n"
"\n"
"As all students of Breton history know, the greatest post-Reman monarch of "
"Shornhelm was King Hurlburt, who led our army at the Battle of Granden Tor "
"and ruled the North from 2E 522 until his death in 546. Hurlburt was of "
"House Branquette, 21st Count of the Name, and had taken as his queen "
"Countess Iphilia of Montclair. When King Hurlburt died his legitimate son, "
"Prince Phylgeon, was only fourteen years of age, and though his inheritance "
"was championed by House Montclair, Houses Branquette and Tamrith supported "
"his elder half-brother, Prince Ranser, who had been born out of wedlock to a "
"poor Tamrith cousin. (House Dorell, typically aloof, declined to endorse "
"either candidate.) \n"
"\n"
"What is less well known is the behind-the-scenes maneuvering that led to "
"Ranser being crowned King of Shornhelm rather than Phylgeon. The advisors of "
"the young Baron Montclair (his mother had predeceased King Hurlburt by a "
"mere two years) contended that he, as the legitimate son, was the proper "
"heir to the throne—a claim further buttressed by language in a codicil to "
"the famous \"\"Bretonnick Natalitie\"\" that declared \"\"Howse Mount "
"Clayre\"\" the royal house of Shornhelm. The Council of the North met to "
"consider the various claimants, but during their deliberations the Montclair "
"advisors found that the Bretonnick codicil had gone missing, while Prince "
"Ranser brought forth a suspiciously long-lost Direnni decree that named "
"House Branquette their \"\"Breton Royal Delegates\"\" in Rivenspire. \n"
"\n"
"The vote of the Council was a narrow victory for Prince Ranser, thereafter "
"King Ranser of Shornhelm. Some of Prince Phylgeon's advisors urged him to "
"fight for the crown, but the young prince declined, preferring to become "
"simply the Baron of Montclair. \n"
"\n"
"Oh, fateful humility! We all know where Phylgeon's deference led—to the "
"tragic events of 566 and the insurrection against the First Daggerfall "
"Covenant in what is known (to our shame) as Ranser's War. According to the "
"standard histories, all the noble houses—Montclair, Tamrith, even "
"Dorell—answered King Ranser's call to muster and marched behind his banner "
"in his fatal war against High King Emeric and the South. What is not "
"generally known is that Count Phylgeon of Montclair was uncertain of the "
"rightness of Ranser's cause, and offered to both Kings Ranser and Emeric to "
"serve as a peace envoy between the two sides. High King Emeric's reply has "
"been lost to history, but Ranser's angry refusal is well known. Once again "
"my father deferred to his elder half-brother, and the Montclair Knights "
"joined Ranser's doomed army. \n"
"\n"
"In the immediate aftermath of King Ranser's fall, Rivenspire fell into chaos."
" The Crown of Shornhelm went missing during the Battle of Traitor's Tor, and "
"the fateful \"\"Direnni decree\"\" that elevated Ranser to the throne has "
"likewise not been seen since. The death of Ranser was the end of the line of "
"House Branquette, and since then there has been no King of Shornhelm, "
"Rivenspire having been jointly ruled by the triumvirate Council of the North."
" That body has tried, with the best of intentions, to keep peace and order "
"in the northern counties, but nobody, if they were speaking honestly, would "
"say the Council's efforts have sufficed. Shornhelm—and the North—need a King."
" \n"
"\n"
"And why shouldn't they have one? If I may speak frankly, setting aside, "
"however regretfully, the traditional Montclair mantle of humility, then I "
"must confess that I, Baron Wylon of Montclair, am certainly the legitimate "
"heir to the throne of Shornhelm. My grandfather was King Hurlburt, and I "
"descend from him in the direct and legitimate line of succession, a claim no "
"one else in the North can make. (That also makes me the sole living heir to "
"the domain of the Branquettes, much of which was unfairly parceled out to "
"the Tamriths and Dorells, but no—humility, always humility!) \n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, at this critical juncture I am fortunate to be able to announce "
"that the long-missing Bretonnick Codicil has been found by the Montclair "
"house historian, the operative clause of which I shall quote here: \n"
"\n"
"\"\"… seeing all in order then in Sharn Helm and its Lands Contyguous, the "
"most royale and high … (unintelligible) … appointeth in Perpetuitie sayde "
"Howse Mount Clayre in rulership over … (unintelligible) … and Sharn Helm. So "
"mote it bee.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"People of Rivenspire, Baron Wylon of Montclair is prepared to do his duty."

"For the royal eyes of the High King Emeric only! (He so loves it when I "
"start these reports this way.)\n"
"\n"
"House Tamrith of Rivenspire has holdings primarily in the western half of "
"that region, with numerous business interests that include agriculture, "
"mercantiles, and commerce. Indeed, it was their thriving trade with the "
"lands to the south that eventually led to strong ties with Stormhaven and "
"the city of Wayrest.\n"
"\n"
"In many ways, the rivalry that marks the interplay of the three most "
"prominent noble houses of Rivenspire (Tamrith, Dorell, and Montclair) dates "
"back to the late period of the First Era, as each house established its "
"reputation and its fortune and helped the region prosper. Of the three, "
"Tamrith has the strongest tradition of piety and religious commitment, and "
"the house has often called upon Arkay as its personal and most favored deity."
"\n"
"\n"
"As the High King is well aware, a good portion of his youth was spent in the "
"company of two of Rivenspire's nobles—Baron Esmark Tamrith and Count "
"Verandis Ravenwatch. And so it was with a heavy heart that the military "
"might of Wayrest and its allies had to be turned against Rivenspire more "
"than a decade ago. At the time, King Ranser of Shornhelm declared war upon "
"Wayrest and forced his nobles to join him in his losing effort. Whatever "
"their true feelings toward Wayrest, the noble houses of Rivenspire obeyed "
"the call of their king and fielded troops against the High King.\n"
"\n"
"In short order, House Tamrith withdrew its support of King Ranser and "
"petitioned for peace. House Dorell was quick to follow suit. Only House "
"Ravenwatch, a relatively small concern compared to the other noble houses of "
"Rivenspire, never took up arms. They remained neutral throughout the year-"
"long conflict. House Montclair, meanwhile, supported King Ranser almost to "
"the bitter end. They finally surrendered to the Wayrest alliance just before "
"the battle that pushed Ranser's remaining forces back to the place now known "
"as Traitor's Tor.\n"
"\n"
"In the aftermath of the conflict, Baron Tamrith emerged as a powerful force "
"for peace and cooperation. It was his idea to form a ruling triumvirate to "
"govern the region in the High King's name, and the leaders of all three "
"noble houses pledged their loyalty to High King Emeric. The High King "
"approved of the triumvirate, but also promised to select a new king of "
"Shornhelm at the first opportunity. (This one reminds the High King that "
"this promise has yet to be fulfilled.)\n"
"\n"
"Baron Esmark Tamrith married the daughter of House Elde, Janece, thus "
"combining their fortunes and creating an even stronger political entity. The "
"couple was blessed with two daughters, the pragmatic and thoughtful Eselde, "
"and the strong and somewhat wilder Janeve. Four years ago, Eselde left "
"Rivenspire to broaden her education and religious studies in Stormhaven, "
"where she was a guest of the High King's court for the majority of that time."
" During the same period, young Janeve (against her father's and sister's "
"wishes) joined the Shornhelm Guard.\n"
"\n"
"Eselde excelled in her studies, taking a particular interest in history, "
"politics, diplomatic studies, and theology. She demonstrated a deep "
"conviction in the teachings of Arkay and the Way of the Light, while also "
"surpassing her contemporaries as a healer and champion of riddle contests. "
"It was clear that she fully intended to prepare herself to eventually take "
"on the mantle of leader of House Tamrith.\n"
"\n"
"Janeve likewise surpassed expectations. She quickly demonstrated amazing "
"combat prowess, military strategy, and an ability to lead others in battle. "
"She earned a number of rapid promotions, eventually becoming a Captain of "
"the Guard. In addition to her role in the Shornhelm military, she also "
"headed up the personal troops of House Tamrith. (For the record, in times of "
"war or other emergencies, it is not uncommon for house troops to join with "
"the city guard to form a single fighting force to defend the region.) If "
"Janeve has a fault, it is her quick temper and love—some might say need—of "
"constant action.\n"
"\n"
"It is with sad tidings that I report of the death of Baron Esmark Tamrith. "
"He passed away just a few short months ago of natural causes. Eselde "
"immediately left Stormhaven to return to Rivenspire and take up the mantle "
"of house leader. Now, as Countess Eselde, she has taken her father's place "
"as part of the ruling triumvirate of Rivenspire. So far, she has been "
"performing admirably in the role, despite the constant disagreements with "
"Baron Dorell. How she will interact with Baron Montclair has yet to be "
"demonstrated, as the Baron has been absent from court these past few months, "
"tending to the needs of his ailing wife.\n"

"In the distant past, the dark and foreboding pinnacle of stone known as the "
"Doomcrag was a place of learning and worship for the Ayleid people. But in "
"recent memory, the place has been known as a haunted peak beyond a "
"treacherous pass of fog and shadow.\n"
"\n"
"Due to the current interest in the often ignored location, Countess Tamrith "
"has asked me to chronicle a few of the legends concerning this forbidden "
"place.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"One dark tale concerns the hero of House Dorell, Brianna the Bold, who "
"traveled to the Shrouded Pass to chase down the bandit lord, Red Rob. "
"Brianna and her troop of knights chased Red Rob all along the northern "
"shore, intent on capturing him and bringing him to justice for his many "
"crimes—including his most recent exploit, the pillaging of a Dorell cargo "
"ship. Unfortunately for Red Rob, the House Baron of the period's daughter "
"was traveling on the ship when Red Rob and his cohorts attacked it. For "
"injuries and insults, she demanded the head of the brigand and dispatched "
"Brianna the Bold to hunt him down.\n"
"\n"
"By the time Brianna reached the entrance to the Shrouded Pass, all of her "
"knights had been killed or wounded. She was on her own. Luckily for her, Red "
"Rob had not fared any better. He was alone when he plunged into the dense "
"fog to avoid her. Not to be deterred, Brianna was true to her name and "
"boldly charged in after him. It was the last time either Brianna or Red Rob "
"were ever seen again.\n"
"\n"
"But locals claim that on clear, cold nights, when a thin, red mist decorates "
"the jutting shard of rock, you can hear the clash of steel on steel as "
"Brianna and Red Rob continue their epic struggle into eternity.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"Another popular, if somewhat disturbing, legend concerning the Doomcrag "
"tells the tale of the spurned Ayleid lover who pines away at the very apex "
"of the mountain. Rejected by a handsome butler in the service of a noble "
"house, the spurned lover climbed to the top of the Doomcrag and refused to "
"come down. Her friends and family tried everything to cheer her up and make "
"her leave the tower. Distraught and sick at heart, she ignored every plea "
"and word of comfort. And when her pain became unbearable, she leaped from "
"the Doomcrag and crashed into the sea far below.\n"
"\n"
"That, however, was not the end of her sad story. People believe that to this "
"very day, handsome travelers who wander too close to the Doomcrag risk "
"attracting the attention of the spurned Ayleid. They say that her restless "
"spirit swoops down and—pardon the wordplay—spirits away the hapless "
"traveler, carrying him to the top of the mountain to keep him as a pet and "
"plaything. Ultimately, however, even the most-patient captive does something "
"to reject and spurn the Ayleid spirit. On lonely nights, or so the story "
"goes, you can hear the intermingled screams as the Ayleid spirit once again "
"hurls herself into the sea, carrying her latest lover with her to a watery "
"grave.\n"
"\n"
"* * *\n"
"\n"
"But perhaps the most common tale told about the Doomcrag describes the Death "
"That Walks. This particular legend is more a cautionary tale than a scary "
"story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. It says that any who attempt "
"to climb the Shrouded Pass inevitably climb to their deaths. With every "
"step, a year of life is lost. Depending on your age and relative level of "
"health, death might overtake you after only a few steps up into the dense "
"fog. Or, if you're particularly lucky, you might ascend all the way to the "
"very top—into the rumored relic chamber—before the Death That Walks catches "
"up with you.\n"
"\n"
"Whichever the case, every step brings with it a measure of pain and weakness "
"as you march to your inevitable demise. This legend, more than any other, "
"has kept the Doomcrag shrouded in mystery, for few have been brave enough to "
"test the veracity of this story.\n"

"Reveiwing my notes, I can see why Countess Tamrith was frightened of the "
"Doomcrag when she was a young girl. If truth be told, even at my advanced "

"By Doctor Nabeth al-Gilane, Khefrem Academy of Yokudan Heritage\n"
"\n"
"I scoffed, of course, when I heard the rumors. A lost colony of Redguards on "
"the northern coast of High Rock? Patently absurd. But the rumors were so "
"persistent, so consistent, that eventually I was moved to take a sabbatical "
"from my pedagogic duties at the Academy and travel north to see for myself. \n"
"\n"
"And behold, by the tears of Morwha, it was so! All of the scholarly details "
"will be found in my forthcoming paper \"\"Sevenfold Truths of the Tribe of "
"the Herd-Mother,\"\" but I shall summarize the main points here, as I feel "
"this tale is too wondrous to wait upon the slow march of scholarship. \n"
"\n"
"On the northwest coast of the High Rock region of Rivenspire, some leagues "
"west of the city of Shornhelm, is a pastoral basin known as the Vale of "
"Silverhoof. Abiding there, as they have for the past three thousand years, "
"is a tribe of Redguards who go by the simple name of the Horsemen. \n"
"\n"
"How did they get there, and when, and why? Unfortunately the Horsemen have "
"no written records, but their oral traditions are strong, and I have "
"recorded those that have been passed down from one generation to the next. "
"The elders of the tribe were generous with their time, particularly two "
"named Muzar and Yalaida, and from their tales I have been able to piece "
"together the following tentative history. \n"
"\n"
"The Horsemen originally came from Yokuda, of this there can be no doubt. "
"Though they have become unavoidably \"\"Bretonized\"\" over the centuries by "
"contact with the Nedic folk who surround them, they retain a number of "
"Yokudan words in daily speech, all spoken with that drawl in the vowels we "
"associate with the steppes of old Akos Kasaz. A few examples will suffice "
"from their riding terminology: to tell a horse to turn left, the Horsemen "
"say \"\"Netu;\"\" to turn right, \"\"Netu Hu;\"\" and to halt, they say "
"\"\"Selim.\"\" Of course, \"\"netu\"\" is Old Yokudan for \"\"turn,\"\" "
"while \"\"anselim\"\" means to stop or to cease. \n"
"\n"
"So the Horsemen are of Yokudan descent, most probably from the herding clans "
"of northern Akos Kasaz. The elders of the tribe maintain detailed oral "
"accounts of their genealogy, and from the number of generations they record, "
"it is possible to date their arrival on the shores of Tamriel to the early "
"sixth century of the First Era. This was a period of upheaval in High Rock, "
"when the Direnni Hegemony was in its death throes and the Breton kingdoms "
"were just establishing themselves, a time when a colony of determined "
"settlers could find a niche and establish itself before it could be driven "
"out or absorbed by the indigenes. And according to the tales I heard from "
"Muzar and Yalaida, this is exactly what happened in the Vale of Silverhoof, "
"nearly two centuries before the Ra Gada came to Hammerfell. \n"
"\n"
"Why the Horsemen came to this land is harder to determine, for on that "
"subject their tales veer into the legendary or even mythical. Here I must "
"speak about the tribe's unorthodox religious beliefs, for they are central "
"to their traditions and identity. For the Horsemen do not worship any of the "
"Old Yokudan gods as we know them, instead venerating a sort of divine "
"animist spirit they call the Herd Mother. This equine entity acts as the "
"tribe's guiding and protective deity; young Horsemen must commune with her "
"on a vision journey they must partake by themselves that acts as a rite of "
"passage to adulthood (similar to our own tradition of Walkabout). This "
"\"\"Herd Mother\"\" is otherwise unknown to modern scholarship, but of "
"course the vast majority of our cultural records were lost in the cataclysm "
"that swallowed the Old Isles. \n"
"\n"
"The Horsemen's tradition is that the tribe left lost Yokuda in order to "
"preserve their worship of this Herd Mother, which was somehow endangered in "
"the Old Isles. Their stories describe the journey from Akos Kasaz in a "
"flotilla of \"\"swimming horse-ships\"\" given them by the Herd Mother, in "
"which they \"\"crossed seventeen seas\"\" before reaching Tamriel. We may "
"discount this tale as somewhat fanciful, but the Horsemen claim to have "
"brought their eponymous mounts with them from the Isles, and this I do not "
"doubt. For to the eye of this connoisseur of horseflesh, the steeds of the "
"Horsemen are unmistakably identical to that breed we call the Yokudan "
"Charger, and could have come directly from the Aswala Stables in the Alik'r."

"I have been tasked with learning everything that I can about the bloodfiends "
"that have been appearing throughout Rivenspire of late. These creatures "
"appear to be exactly the same as other bloodfiends we have examined in the "
"past. But for all their similarities, they have one telling and significant "
"difference—they appear at the beginning of the vampiric cycle instead of at "
"the end. \n"
"\n"
"Instead of appearing at the end of an otherwise long and grueling vampiric "
"gestation period, this process changes ordinary citizens into feral monsters "
"in a frighteningly short amount of time. It's almost like a fevered blood "
"affliction that burns through individuals at an alarming rate. While not "
"everyone who comes in contact with the catalyst becomes afflicted, those who "
"do either turn into a vampire (rarely) or quickly spiral into the frenzied "
"madness that characterizes all bloodfiends (the most likely outcome).\n"
"\n"
"My investigations suggest that these bloodfiends have a connection to the "
"Argonian Reezal-Jul and Lady Lleraya Montclair. The court magician of House "
"Montclair and the daughter of Baron Wylon Montclair have been leading "
"Montclair troops across Rivenspire—troops that include vampires. There have "
"been rumors of a blood-curse, some sort of foul magic that allows Reezal-Jul "
"and Lleraya to turn ordinary citizens into bloodfiends with nothing but a "
"glance, a wave of a hand, and a few muttered words. Eyewitness reports have "
"been confused, at best, and these claims have yet to be fully verified. \n"
"\n"
"As with other bloodfiends dealt with in the past, the Rivenspire bloodfiends "
"are vampires that have gone insane. Their minds have degraded beyond "
"recovery, and they attack anything that moves with no regard for their own "
"wellbeing. They are feral, violent creatures driven by their carnal lust for "
"bones and blood. This strain of the blood-curse runs its course at an "
"alarmingly rapid pace. I have documented instances of citizens being "
"afflicted and turning feral in mere moments. How Reezal-Jul and Lleraya came "
"by this terrible power is unknown. What is known is that they seem to be "
"Oblivion-bent on helping Baron Montclair conquer the entirety of Rivenspire.\n"

"Upon a time, in the realm of Cutcap, there was a mighty king named Rulthrub "
"who ruled nobly and long. After many years King Rulthrub felt himself "
"getting old, and started to think about what would happen to his realm after "
"he was gone. Now this king was blessed with two sons, which normally would "
"be a happy thing for an aging monarch, but in this case it was a problem. "
"For the younger son who had been born of his queen, Prince Pigeon, was weak-"
"willed and indifferent. In contrast the elder son, Prince Lancer, was bold "
"and self-assured, and though his mother was of House Rithmat, the noblest in "
"Cutcap, still Prince Lancer had undeniably been born out of wedlock.\n"
"\n"
"Now King Rulthrub was a wise king, and did not try to conceal that he "
"favored his elder son, Prince Lancer, as he was clearly the prince most fit "
"to rule. But nonetheless when the old king finally went to Aetherius, some "
"people felt that the milksop Prince Pigeon should take the throne. I don't "
"know whether these people were merely misguided, or had some other reason "
"why they thought the rulership of Cutcap should be undermined. Fortunately "
"wiser heads prevailed and Prince Lancer was elected King of Cutcap by the "
"Council of Nobles.\n"
"\n"
"Shortly after Lancer's accession to the throne he met a demoiselle named "
"Lady Vespire at a ball and fell in love. The lovely and clever Vespire was a "
"daughter of House Rithmat, and after a brief courtship King Lancer told his "
"Council of Nobles that she would be his queen. However, Count Pigeon (the "
"former prince) objected that this would not be proper as King Lancer's "
"mother had been a Rithmat, and by the Law of Consanguinity the Lady Vespire "
"was too close a relation for marriage. On this the rest of the council "
"agreed, and King Lancer was persuaded to set the young lady aside. Upon "
"hearing this news, Lady Vespire disappeared, said to have been carried off "
"into the forests by a coterie of nixads, and though the king sent out search "
"parties, his lost love was never found.\n"
"\n"
"In due course the council recommended, for the sake of the dynasty, that "
"King Lancer marry the young and healthy Lady Ignort of House Dull, and this, "
"heartbroken, he agreed to. Lancer and Ignort were married, and King Lancer "
"settled down to do his kingly duty by his new queen. Within a few months it "
"was announced that Queen Ignort had borne King Lancer a child. A Naming-Day "
"festival was declared for the infant princess, and everyone important in the "
"realm was invited.\n"
"\n"

"laid presents at the foot of the cradle of Princess Arayelle, for thus she "
"had been named. But at the end of the line came someone no one recognized: a "
"dire Wyrd-Hag, hooded and cloaked, and bearing a darksome flower. Now, no "
"Wyrd-Hags had been seen in Cutcap since the Year of Sun's-Death, but all "
"feared her and none dared bar her passage. \n"

"Vespire, now a Wyress of the Wyrd!\"\" The gaily-clad crowd fell back in "
"horror, for the formerly pretty Lady Vespire now sported a large nose "
"disfigured by unsightly warts. \"\"By some oversight you failed to invite me "
"to your daughter's Naming Day, but I have come nonetheless. And look—I have "
"brought the infant princess a present!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"What present is this?\"\" said King Lancer, all a-tremble. \"\"A "
"darksome flower? I like not its look!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"That's no surprise, Your Majesty,\"\" said the Wyrd-Hag mockingly, "
"\"\"for this is a Forsaken Rose, a blossom no one wants! I know what that is "
"like, King Lancer—and so, by my curse, shall your daughter!\"\" The horrible "
"Hag then dropped the misshapen bloom upon the baby and disappeared in a "
"flash of fire and a cloud of evil-smelling smoke. \n"
"\n"
"So it came to pass: Princess Arayelle grew up beautiful as a rose, but cross-"
"grained and petulant. But she was nonetheless a princess of the north, so "
"when King Emetick of the South came looking for a bride, their troth was "
"quickly plighted. \n"
"\n"
"But Count Pigeon had long made a habit of visiting the South, and was a boon "
"companion of King Emetick. And he pointed out to the King of the South that "
"Arayelle was cross-grained and petulant, and he might make a stronger match "
"by marrying the Princess of Watchtower. In time Emetick agreed. He broke his "
"match with Arayelle and promised himself to the Princess of Watchtower. \n"
"\n"
"King Lancer, however, did not take this lightly, and swore he would go to "
"war upon the oath-breaking King of the South. And he made lawful war upon "
"King Emetick, but at the Battle of the Tor, Lancer was betrayed by one of "
"his own generals. King Lancer was slain, his crown and Princess Arayelle "
"both disappeared, and ever since the Throne of Cutcap has stood empty. \n"
"\n"
"But some say that when King Lancer was born a twin sister likewise saw the "
"light of the world, but was spirited away by a Wyrd-Hag to be raised in the "
"forests. And this child, a daughter of both Rulthrub and Rithmat, herself "
"bore a daughter who was brought back to her maternal family. And this "
"daughter was named Countess Eselde. \n"
"\n"
"And if the truth were told, all would know that her real title should be "
"Princess Eselde. And she, and no other, is the rightful heir to the Throne "
"of Cutcup. However, that is a tale for her people to tell."

"The burial grounds of Westmark Moor, known to many as the Sanguine Barrows, "
"have developed an unsavory reputation among locals over the course of their "
"history. The nobles of Rivenspire have buried their departed beneath the "
"gnarled trees here for as long as anyone alive today remembers, laying "
"relatives to rest among centuries-old crypts that have borne witness to "
"corruption, disputes, theft, and worse. \n"
"\n"
"Many prominent northern nobles inter their dead in Westmark's cold earth, "
"including the Dorell, Tamrith, and Montclair families. Though some of these "
"houses have produced Kings and Queens of Shornhelm, those deceased do not "
"rest with their relatives here. Instead, they are transported to join the "
"other monarchs of High Rock in the great cemetery of Cath Bedraud in "
"Glenumbra, per long-standing tradition.\n"
"\n"
"Feuds between the houses over the titles to gravesites in the Sanguine "
"Barrows are common. One incident in Mid Year of 2E 551 earned the burial "
"grounds their unfortunate common name. As I recall, it so happened that the "
"Tamrith and Montclair houses both suffered the loss of a family member on "
"the same day. The houses' claims in the barrows bordered one another and had "
"been a source of strife between them for many years. When both funeral "
"processions arrived one morning on the same hill in front of the same "
"gravesite (a highly desirable one with a view of the river), conflict was "
"inevitable.\n"
"\n"
"The nobles quarreled for hours and sent servants back and forth for "
"documents, titles, and maps with official claims laid out, but neither house "
"could be convinced to step down. As sunset approached, patience was in short "
"supply. The Montclairs and the Tamriths each blame the other, "
"unsurprisingly, for hurling the insult that provoked the houses into drawing "
"steel, and the Bloody Funeral (as it came to be called) that ensued left a "
"black mark on each house's legacy in the eyes of Rivenspire's people.\n"
"\n"
"Looting and desecration are likewise common among the Sanguine Barrows. "
"Though the responsibility of patrolling them belongs to the constabulary of "
"Hoarfrost Downs, the lure of riches is sometimes enough to turn a protector "
"into a criminal, or at least enough to turn his head and allow entry to the "
"tombs. More than once, a King or Queen of Shornhelm has ordered a hanging to "
"set an example against such behavior. \n"
"\n"
"Despite these harsh consequences, a new defacement or theft still seems to "
"follow nearly every noble burial. In fact, it has only been a few years "
"since the Tamriths were scandalized when an entire crypt was found empty one "
"morning of everything—bodies and all. The thieves were never found, and as "
"to why they'd take the bodies with their loot, well, we'd all prefer not to "
"think of it.\n"
"\n"
"The Sanguine Barrows have seen more than their share of villainy and "
"conflict throughout the years, and earned their name many times over. I "
"sincerely hope that no more tales of violence or robbery shall need to be "
"added to this record, and that the nobles still buried there may rest "
"peacefully for ages to come."

"생귄 무덤(Sanguine Barrows)으로 알려진 웨스트 마크 무어 (Westmark Moor)의 무덤은 역사를 보면 지역 주민들 "
"사이에서 평판이 좋지 않다는 사실을 알 수 있다. 리븐스파이어의 귀족(The nobles of Rivenspire)들은 오늘 날 그들의 "
"부패, 분쟁, 약탈 등을 목격 한 몇백 년 간의 더러움을 이 울퉁불퉁한 썩은 나무 밑에 묻었다. \n"
"\n"
"많은 유명한 북부 귀족들은 도렐, 탐리스, 몽클레어(Dorell, Tamrith, Montclair) 구성원들을 포함하여 웨스트 마크의 "
"얼어붙은 묘지에 묻힌다. 그렇지만 이들 집 가운데 태어난 숀헬름(Shornhelm)의 왕과 왕비들은 휴식처가 되지못한다. 대신에 그들은 "
"오래된 전통에 따른 하이록(High Rock)의 캐스 배드라우드(Cath Bedraud) 대 묘지에 묻히도록 운송된다.\n"
"\n"
"이들 구성원들과의 불화가 생기는 것은 생귄 무덤에서는 흔한 일이다. Mid Year of 2E 551에 일어난 사건으로 매장지에는 불행한 "
"이름이 붙여졌다. 내가 기억하기로는 Tamrith와 Montclair의 가문이 같은 날에 가족을 잃었다. 그 가문들의 주장에 의하면 "
"묘지가 서로 접해있었고, 이는 몇년간의 다툼의 씨가 되었다. 같은 두 장례의 행렬이 똑같은 날에 똑같은 언덕에 똑같은 식(명당이자, 강이 "
"훤히 보이는)에 있다면 분쟁과 다툼은 불가피할 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"이 가문들은 몇시간 동안 싸움을 벌여왔고 문서와 직함, 위치등을 공식적으로 주장하였지만 이들 가문 누구든 이 중에서 물러설거라고는  "
"확신할 수는 없었다. 해가 저물어오자 인내심이 바닥이 났다. Montclairs와 Tamriths 가문들은 서로를 비난하였고, 놀랍지 "
"않게도 이들 가문의 유산은 이러한 모욕과 Bloody Funeral (이후에 이렇게 불리우게된)에 뒤따른 오점이 Rivenspire의 "
"목격자들의 눈에 남아 있었다.\n"
"\n"
"약탈과 신성모독은 생귄 무덤에 있어서도 흔한 일이다. 다만 그들을 체포할 책임은 Hoarfrost Downs의 순찰대에게 있지만, 돈의 "
"유혹은 때때로 보호받는 자가 범죄자로 변하기도 하고 적어도 무덤으로 보낼 정도로 충분하다. 몇번이고 숀헬름의 왕과 왕비는 이러한 행동에 "
"대한 본보기를 주기 위해 교수형을 명령했다.\n"
"\n"
"이런 냉혹한 결과에도 불구하고 새로운 도굴이나, 약탈은 귀족들의 무덤을 따라다녔다. 몇년 밖에 안된 사실은 지하실에 있는 모든 시체가 "
"약탈 당했을 때에는 Tamriths 가문은 심하게 분하였다. 도둑은 찾지 못했다. 왜 그들이 자신들의 전리품으로 시체를 가져가는지 우리는 "
"생각을 하지 않으려 했다.\n"
"\n"
"생귄 무덤은 수년간에 걸쳐 그들의 더러움과 갈등을 목격했고, 그들의 이름을 여러번 몇년간 불려졌다. 나는 더 이상 폭력이나 강도 사건에 "
"대한 이야기가 기록에 쓰여지지 않길 바라며, 또한 그곳에 묻혀있는 귀족들이 오랜 세월 동안 편안히 쉴 수 있도록 간절히 바라는 바이다."
