"Old Summerset Folktale, Author Unknown\n"
"Transcribed by Relicmaster Glenadir\n"
"\n"
"There once was an artist of great talent. Her eyes shined with worlds "
"unseen, so magnificent and bright that beautiful Summerset paled in "
"comparison. She tried to paint these vibrant scenes, but found common colors "
"lacking. How could she bring her visions to life?\n"
"\n"
"In this hour of desperation, a poor merchant knocked on her door. He was a "
"scraggly old man, with no companion but the hound at his feet.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Would you consider buying this paintbrush?\"\" the poor merchant asked. "
"\"\"I see by your house that you're an artist. With this you'll be able to "
"truly bring life into your work.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Intrigued, the artist agreed to pay a meager sum for this paintbrush. It was "
"rather large, with a white tip and black ivory handle. She was told it was "
"called the Monochrome Paintbrush, but to not let the name fool her. And so "
"the old merchant left with a satisfied smile on his face.\n"
"\n"
"The artist went to work at once, and before her eyes the impossible occurred."
" What had been mere paint just moments before became sparkling and shining, "
"with depths yet unknown. It went beyond color and emotion, transcended "
"anything she had seen before. Finally, finally, the colors matched those "
"images she had long since had in her head.\n"
"\n"
"But, as she painted, a strange thing happened. First, the color began to "
"fade from her lips, the tips of her fingers, the point of her nose. Her hair "
"turned from a golden yellow to a faded white, her clothes lost their blue "
"and purples and turned to shades of gray.\n"
"\n"
"She did not notice. She painted, and painted, and painted away. She was lost "
"within the scene she was creating, and her body turned white, and black, and "
"gray. Her eyes grew heavy, and heartbeats further and further apart, until "
"suddenly she collapsed.\n"
"\n"
"Before her body was the most beautiful painting in all of Summerset. It's "
"said to still hang to this day, though it was never seen in Nirn again."

"It happened. It happened, it happened. The scar. The scar on my cheek, it's "
"there. There, on my cheek, and now I know that my end is soon. I'm going to "
"die.\n"
"\n"
"I knew I should have never looked into that mirror, but my curiosity was too "
"great. I thought for sure I would look back to see an old man, but the eyes "
"that stared back were the same. Only eighty years old and staring back at my "
"own death. The only difference—that scar on my cheek.\n"

"Honored Sapiarch Tematilana,\n"
"\n"
"Thank you for your most gracious acceptance of my son's case. As a mother, "
"my only wish is that you may help Narlindri recover as soon as possible. I "
"fear he has not slept in days, so he most likely will not be able to answer "
"your questions. I hope my account will be sufficient for your needs.\n"
"\n"
"Upon further inspection, we still are unsure of who gifted Narlindril the "
"lute. He just turned twelve, and the celebration banquet had a great deal of "
"guests and presents. I fear that we'll never found out, given my son's "
"current state. Now I can see that it was most obviously a trap.\n"
"\n"
"The lute was beautiful, and Narlindril took to it right away. That very "
"night he began to attempt the first song which came with the accompanying "
"music book. At first I thought him merely diligent, but as the night wore on "
"I grew tired of the noise. When I told him to cease, he refused to meet my "
"eye and simply kept playing. No matter what I said, I couldn't get him to "
"stop. Finally, I grabbed the lute from his hands, demanding he go to his "
"room for the evening.\n"
"\n"
"He didn't say anything at first, but began to tremble. His entire body, "
"shaking all at once. Then he fell to the ground in anguish, his limbs "
"convulsing. He cried out, \"\"Mother! Please, give me the lute!\"\" his "
"voice pained, as if he was being tortured.\n"
"\n"
"Of course I gave him back the lute, fearful for my son's life. He hasn't "
"stopped playing since, and we're reaching our third day. Our family's "
"healers haven't left his side, but it pains me to see his fingers cut and "
"bleed. He hasn't slept, he barely drinks and eats, and always he plays that "
"cursed lute.\n"
"\n"
"My husband will accompany Narlindril on his journey, and can answer any "
"further questions you have. Please, if anything can be done, our family will "
"owe you a great debt. No cost is too great for the life of our only son.\n"

"\n"
"Suspect taken into custody and staff under magical quarantine. Official "
"documents within suspect's home reveals he was commissioned to create the "
"staff for a prominent weaver within the city. It's theorized that the staff "
"was originally intended to unravel tangled threads.\n"
"\n"
"Several eye witness accounts have been collected from the incident:\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Yes, I've been Anillyon's neighbor for several years now. He told me all "
"about it. Called it the Unraveling Staff. Last I heard, it was working "
"spectacularly. Why, what happened?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"It was madness! He was running down the street, laughing maniacally. And "
"everywhere he pointed, the poor mer's clothes would just fall right apart! "
"So embarrassing.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"I don't know about clothes falling apart. I was too distracted by the "
"buildings coming undone! Stones and planks, flying from their place as if "
"they were alive. I didn't know about—how many deaths, did you say?\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Yes, I saw it. He pointed the staff and—oh, she was just a young woman. "
"I'll try to describe it but. Oh, that poor thing. It's as if her flesh "
"just—I'm sorry, I don't think I can continue.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Suspect detained until court approved date. No bail will be offered."

"We have to cancel the plan. That skeeving mage has done us real dirty. You "
"would think our previous threats would be enough, but there we go. Next I "
"see him, I'll make sure to acquaint him with the sharp end of my axe. For "
"now, just know that the quill's useless, at least for our needs. \n"
"\n"
"Our troubles with the darn thing are twofold. First, the mage never told us "
"that whoever used the quill would also believe what they wrote! Which hey, "
"perhaps we could work around, if we had any control with what was written. "
"It's a tricky enchantment, whatever it is. Had to tie down the last two "
"fools who attempted to write with it. The quill convinced one to jump off a "
"tall roof, and the other to—well, let's just say it's getting creative. "
"Rather not repeat it.\n"
"\n"
"I'd say we should throw the cursed thing in a river, but it could prove to "
"be worth something to someone. I'll try to get a client stupid enough to buy "
"such a thing. There's always collectors for this stuff, you just got to know "
"where to look."
