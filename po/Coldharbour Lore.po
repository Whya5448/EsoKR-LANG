"By Kynval Zzedenkathik of Clan Deathbringer\n"
"\n"
"For as long as I can remember—and like all Dremora my memory is keen, "
"especially for grievances—I have faithfully served the officers of my clan, "
"and through them, My Lord Molag Bal. And yet not always: for once, to my "
"shame, I was compelled to serve another. \n"
"\n"
"I was on guard duty at the Endless Stair, an assignment I always enjoy, for "
"I can mock and torment the passing Soul Shriven without being held "
"responsible for them meeting their quotas. Leaping out from behind a claw-"
"pillar while shouting, \"\"There you are, weakling!\"\" just never loses its "
"appeal.\n"
"\n"
"I was lurking behind a Dark Anchor chain link, preparing to terrify an "
"approaching Soul Shriven by suddenly knocking her down and sneering, \"\"No "
"match at all,\"\" when I suddenly felt a strange tingling all over, from my "
"horns down to my toes. I grew dizzy as the plane spun around me, nearly fell "
"into a pool of blue plasm, and then suddenly felt myself hurled into an "
"endless black void. \n"
"\n"
"I wasn't alarmed at first, because who hasn't been hurled into an endless "
"black void? It wasn't until I began to materialize at my destination and got "
"a taste of the air that I had my first misgivings. \"\"I smell … "
"weakness,\"\" I said to myself—and I couldn't have been more right. \n"
"\n"
"It was then that I first heard the voice of my Conjurer as he said, \"\"Ah, "
"this one looks fairly robust,\"\" and the full horror of my situation broke "
"upon me. For I had been summoned to do the bidding … of a mortal. \n"
"\n"
"I turned, aghast, to see who had dared summon me across the infinities to "
"Nirn, and found myself faced with a tall Elf of Summerset. Oh, I recognized "
"the type: I'd abused more than a few Altmeri Soul Shriven in my time, and "
"with gusto, for they evince a haughty arrogance entirely inappropriate in "
"mere mortals. This one gave me a brief, appraising look, and then turned "
"away, saying, \"\"Follow and fight. There are Worm Cultists that need "
"slaying.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Worm Cultists. Can you imagine the ignominy, fellow kyn? Not only had I been "
"conjured away from my duty by one of the hated Elven mortals, but I must "
"serve him by slaying the minions of Mannimarco, our Dread Lord's lieutenant "
"and viceroy-to-be! I tried to resist, flexing my indomitable will, but the "
"mortal mage's binding spell was too strong—all I could do was say, \"\"No "
"one escapes!\"\" and follow him past a pair of torches into a subterranean "
"maze of tunnels. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"You serve the great Vanus Galerion, Dremora,\"\" my Conjurer announced, "
"quite unnecessarily—for what need had I to know the name of my slavemaster? "
"But then I reconsidered, and mentally added his name to that long list each "
"of us keeps: the list labeled, \"\"Vengeance.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"I followed, not deigning to crouch when my Conjurer hunched over to sneak, "
"merely glaring at him and thinking, \"\"I will feast upon your heart.\"\" In "
"truth, however, it was as well that I had this Elf Vanus to follow, for the "
"tunnels were many and twisting, and though we Dremora are fearless, "
"relentless, and unparalleled among warriors throughout Oblivion, our sense "
"of direction is rather poor. When doing courier duty, I've been known to "
"lose my way right in the middle of the Moonless Walk and wind up back at the "
"Lightless Oubliette where I started. \n"
"\n"
"In time this Vanus began to pause frequently, listening, which only "
"increased my irritation and impatience. Finally he stopped, with a "
"\"\"Shh!\"\" to me—which was completely unfair, as I hadn't said a word. But "
"I realized why he'd stopped when I suddenly heard human speech from the "
"tunnel ahead. Hesitating nary an instant, I drew my greatsword and rushed "
"forward, crying \"\"A challenger is near!\"\" The Elf cursed and followed, "
"but he had only himself to blame—I was following his orders exactly. \n"
"\n"
"The next minute passed in the red fury that all true Dremora feel when they "
"enter battle. But my usual enjoyment of bloody slaughter was tainted by the "
"knowledge that I was killing those my Dread Lord would prefer I didn't, and "
"frankly, that just ruined the whole experience for me. As I lopped off the "
"limbs and heads of the Worm Cultists, I was aware of the energies of the "
"Elf's powerful magics crackling past me, incinerating the more distant "
"enemies, but I was too mortified to enjoy the orgy of destruction. The Elf "
"came striding up as I subdivided the final Worm Anchorite, gloating, \"\"So "
"much for them. Take that, Mannimarco!\"\" \n"
"\n"
"\"\"There could be no other end,\"\" I replied sourly, then felt the strange "
"tingling again as the conjuration that had brought me to Nirn began to "
"weaken. As the bonds dissolved I took one menacing step toward the Elf, but "
"then the plane spun around me again, and it was back into the endless black "
"void. \n"
"\n"
"When I came to my senses I was lying in a pool of turquoise slime, looking "
"up at the smiling face of my superior, Kynreeve Xalxorkig. \"\"So, "
"Zzedenkathik,\"\" he snarled, \"\"straying from your post when on duty, eh? "
"It's the scathe-rings for you, my lad!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"\"\"But, Kynreeve,\"\" I cried, leaping to attention, \"\"I couldn't help "
"it! I was conjured, summoned to Nirn—by a mortal!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"Xalxorkig smiled even wider. \"\"And that'll be an extra shift scathing for "
"telling such a hornless lie. Now march, Zzedenkathik,\"\" he shouted, "
"thumping me with his truncheon. \"\"Left, right, left, right, left, right …."

"\n"
"나를 소환한 자가 “아, 이번 놈은 제법 팔팔해 뵈는군.”이라고 말했을 때에야 내 상황의 실체가 무섭게 다가왔다. 나는 시키는 대로 "

"By Doctor Rhythandius\n"
"\n"
"As a Doctor of Transliminal Mythomysticism, I have long been interested in "
"the soul/body problem, the reformation of the Daedric body post-banishment, "
"and the formation of the body around the essence commonly known as the "
"\"\"vestige.\"\" Since our enforced relocation to Coldharbour, courtesy of "
"Our Luminous Lady, I have had considerable opportunity to observe these "
"processes first-hand, and am now in a position to confirm many hypotheses "
"that, upon Mundus, were fated to remain mere conjecture. \n"
"\n"
"It has long been understood that a Daedra, who lacks the Anuic animus known "
"as the \"\"soul,\"\" is not killed when its body is destroyed. A Daedra "
"slain upon Mundus is merely \"\"banished\"\" back to its plane of origin, "
"where its morphotype, or \"\"vestige,\"\" gradually forms a new body, so "
"that eventually the Daedra lives again. (This happens as well when a Daedra "
"is slain in its native Oblivion.)\n"
"\n"
"Furthermore, we have long known from the Daedra themselves that their bodies "
"are formed from the very stuff of chaos, the \"\"creatia\"\" of Oblivion, a "
"shapeless but energetic material that accretes around a vestige until it "
"conforms to the morphotype's inherent pattern. \n"
"\n"
"Back on Mundus I had naively envisioned this creatia as some sort of misty, "
"amorphous material swirling in a void somewhere. After our arrival in "
"Coldharbour, it was some time before I realized that its ubiquitous pools of "
"blue slime, the substance we've come to call \"\"Azure Plasm,\"\" was in "
"fact the form that creatia takes upon this plane. By extension, I reasoned "
"that chaotic creatia takes a different but planar-appropriate form in every "
"realm of Oblivion—and this theory was later confirmed for me by the rogue "
"Xivilai known as the Sojourner, who has had direct experience of numerous "
"planes of existence. \n"
"\n"
"In fact, it was the Sojourner who first introduced me to one of those secret "
"grottoes where one can observe the process of plasm-accretion in action. (To "
"find such grottoes, where Daedra are \"\"born,\"\" it is necessary only to "
"observe the slow flow of the Azure Plasm and follow it to its "
"destination—for plasm-accretion causes a slow drain on adjacent pools.) It "
"was fascinating to watch a vestige gradually absorbing Azure Plasm and "
"converting it from the general to specific, so that over time it slowly took "
"on the size and shape of a hulking, reptilian daedroth. \n"
"\n"
"Then there are the poor slaves known as the Soul Shriven. Each is a mortal "
"kidnapped from Mundus at the moment of death, his or her soul stolen by "
"Molag Bal for some unthinkable purpose, and given in exchange the vestige "
"that enables him or her to form a counterfeit body here in Coldharbour. But "
"they are not native to Oblivion, so a Soul Shriven's body is a sad imitation "
"of the body worn in life, suffering rapid wear and decay until it dies—a "
"death that is no liberation, for its vestige only forms a body once again, "
"over and over, ad infinitum ….\n"
"\n"
"Such are the facts. What follows is speculation, born of conversations with "
"the Sojourner during his infrequent and unpredictable visits. His theory is "
"that the Soul Shriven's bodies are flawed because they have lost the "
"focusing principle of their Anuic souls, so their vestiges are imperfect "
"patterns. I concurred that this was likely, and then proposed the "
"theoretical possibility of a Soul Shriven who, despite having lost his or "
"her soul, possessed some other intrinsic Anuic aspect. This shall-we-say "
"\"\"paragon\"\" Soul Shriven would form an unflawed body in Coldharbour that "
"was a perfect duplicate of the body worn in Mundus. In fact, if this paragon "
"bore a sufficiently high Anuic valence, upon contact with Padomaic creatia "
"its body would form almost instantaneously. \n"
"\n"
"The Sojourner scoffed at my theory, but seemed taken with the idea "
"nonetheless. He went on to speculate that if such a thing were possible, it "
"would probably occur in a situation where the Mundus was in existential "
"jeopardy. In that case the Heart of Nirn would spontaneously generate such "
"\"\"paragon\"\" individuals as a way of defending itself from destruction, "
"in a manner analogous to the way the mortal body fights off infection. \n"
"\n"
"Ah, Sojourner—how I miss your stimulating conversation. Such flights of "
"fantasy! And yet, given the wonders I've seen in my prolonged existence upon "
"this plane, is anything really impossible?"

"(Author Unknown)\n"
"\n"
"There was, in those days, a city in the Heartland, Delodiil by name. And it "
"was a city of pleasant promenades, of learned scholars, of meticulous "
"artisans, and of lissome dancers. And also did Delodiil have warriors fierce "
"and proud, who protected the promenades, and the scholars, and the artisans, "
"and the dancers. And though the warriors were few, they were bold.\n"
"\n"
"Now the people of Delodiil worshiped many gods, for they were devout and "
"held all the Divines in reverence. But above all others they did venerate "
"the Lady of Light, building for Merid-Nunda a chapel of colored rays and "
"beams, which was for glory like a piece of Aetherius brought down to the "
"mortal world. And the people of Delodiil were proud thereon.\n"
"\n"
"But across the valley was another city, Abagarlas, which was to the darkness "
"as Delodiil was to the light. Now Abagarlas had as many citizens as "
"Delodiil, but few were dancers, artisans, and scholars, because most were "
"warriors fierce and proud. These warriors were lended to other states and "
"cities for the making of war in return for wealth. And thus did Abagarlas, "
"in its own way, prosper.\n"
"\n"
"Now the King of Abagarlas saw the chapel of lights that was the pride of "
"Delodiil, and he said, \"\"Is not Abagarlas as great a city as Delodiil? We "
"shall have a great chapel of our own.\"\" And he decreed that much of the "
"wealth of Abagarlas be spent in the building of a shrine to his own patron "
"Divine, who was the Lord Mola Gbal. And the people of Abagarlas reared up a "
"vast shrine to Mola Gbal, but they were but rude soldiers rather than "
"artisans, and the shrine was misshapen, ill-colored, and burdensome to look "
"upon. But it was, nonetheless, larger than Delodiil's chapel of lights, and "
"thus the King of Abagarlas boasted that his city was greater therefore than "
"Delodiil. But the people of Delodiil evinced no dismay, and went about their "
"business as before. \n"
"\n"
"And this unconcern of the Delodiils ate a hole into the heart of the King of "
"Abagarlas, and he was vexed unto madness. He sent soldiers to profane the "
"small shrine to Merid-Nunda in Abagarlas, and then went to his vast shrine "
"to Mola Gbal, where he swore a mighty oath. And slaying a family of visiting "
"Delodiils on the altar, the King vowed that he would gather his army, march "
"across the valley, and capture all the Delodiils, sacrificing them to Mola "
"Gbal within the chapel of lights. \n"
"\n"
"And the King of Abagarlas mustered all his soldiers, and on a night in which "
"the skies were lit by a furious racing aurora, he marched them across the "
"valley to Delodiil. But when the King and his army arrived they found the "
"land empty, for the city of Delodiil was gone, unto every brick! \n"
"\n"
"And the King thought he heard laughter in the lights in the skies, mirth "
"that turned to shrieks of fear that came, not from above, but from back "
"across the valley. In haste the King marched his soldiers back to his city, "
"but when they arrived at Abagarlas, they found it utterly destroyed as if by "
"scorching light. And of the families of the soldiers and the King, nothing "
"could be found but their shadows burnt into the walls of the city. \n"
"\n"
"Thus Abagarlas. But of the fate of Delodiil, nothing more was known."

"By Phrastus of Elinhir\n"
"\n"
"Truly, the Tract of Merid-Nunda is one of the strangest and least understood "
"works of mythohistory that has come down to us from the early First Era. It "
"exists only in partial manuscript form, a single copy of which resides in "
"the library of the Arcane University at the Imperial City. (Or at least it "
"did, though since the Mages Guild was blamed for the disappearance of the "
"Emperor Varen and driven out of Cyrodiil, I don't know what has become of "
"their once-admirable library.) \n"
"\n"
"Fortunately, I was granted an opportunity to study the noted Tract in detail "
"while the Guild was still in possession of it, and made a personal copy for "
"myself so I could continue to unravel its mysteries once I'd returned to "
"Elinhir. \n"
"\n"
"The problem of understanding the Tract of Merid-Nunda is twofold: First, the "
"extant document is clearly part of a larger work, drawn from seemingly "
"somewhere in the middle, and without the preceding and following portions of "
"the work we have little context for the part that remains. Second, the Tract "
"is written in a peculiar argot that employs Ayleid phrases in a late Nedic "
"syntax, including many words of unknown origin that don't appear in any "
"other source. \n"
"\n"
"However, working outward from fragments previously translated by Wenegrus "
"Monhana and Herminia Cinna, I believe I can shed some new light on certain "
"key passages in this mysterious manuscript. Our format shall be to provide "
"the translation of each passage, followed by my interpretation of its "
"meaning.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"… were known as the Nine Coruscations, who followed the parabolas that "
"led away from Magnus. Merid-Nunda was of these Sisters, as was Mnemo-Li, as "
"was Xero-Lyg, as was ….\"\"\n"
"\n"
"This appears to identify the \"\"Daedric Prince\"\" Meridia with the so-"
"called Star-Orphans, those Anuic ur-entities that separated from Magnus when "
"that Divine withdrew from the creation of the Aurbis. The best-known of "
"these Star-Orphans is probably Mnemoli the Blue Star, who is associated with "
"un-time events, and was said to be visible even in the daytime sky at the "
"time of the Dragon Break. \n"
"\n"
"\"\"… thus we call upon Cenedelin to bind the earth, as we speak to Merid-"
"Nunda regarding the light, for she is the scintilla that fears not darkness, "
"and swims the waves of pull and spin ….\"\"\n"
"\n"
"For the Ayleids, of course, Light was one of the four elements of creation, "
"and this passage seems to confirm that Meridia was the personification of "
"Light to the Wild Elves. Though I am certain of this passage's translation, "
"I confess the meaning of the final phrases eludes me.\n"
"\n"
"The next passage was quite difficult, but its translation adds an entirely "
"new episode to our accounts of the Dawn Era:\n"
"\n"
"\"\"The Lords of the Chaos-Realms chided Merid-Nunda for her trespass and "
"bade her return to Aurbis, claiming all existing spheres as their own. But "
"Merid-Nunda formed of her substance a great drag-lens, and the light of "
"Magnus was bent thereby. The rays [carved? focused?] a new sphere from the "
"chaos, which Merid-Nunda, [laughing? sparkling?], did claim for her own.\"\"\n"
"\n"
"This appears to recount the origin of the Colored Rooms, as Meridia's "
"Oblivion realm is known, seemingly formed directly out of the stuff of chaos "
"by an act of divine will. \n"
"\n"
"And finally:\n"
"\n"
"\"\"… thus does Merid-Nunda [ride? slide?] across the rainbow road from end "
"to end, at one end stretching the dragon, at the other end compressing him …."
"\"\"\n"
"\n"
"A curious passage indeed. The \"\"dragon,\"\" of course, traditionally "
"refers to the Divine we know as Akatosh, the God of Time. This seems to "
"suggest that by traveling the \"\"rainbow road\"\" (a reference to the "
"prismatic refraction of light?), Meridia can in some sense alter the rate at "
"which time flows forward. \n"
"\n"
"Altering the \"\"speed\"\" of time? Is this merely an absurd conceit of the "
"late Ayleid sorcerer-priests, or a genuine insight into the nature of one of "
"the least-understood Daedric Princes? \n"
"\n"
"Who can say?"
