"By Cyrillo the Deranged\n"
"\n"
"They call me mad and have branded me insane. I accept the title they have "
"given me, and wear it proudly as a badge of honor. For the name I now carry "
"shows that I was willing to enter the dark places, over and over again. To "
"brave the ruins of madness and chaos to bring knowledge to the world. The "
"Three protect me from the things I have discovered, and keep my mind clear "
"long enough to share this knowledge with the world!\n"
"\n"
"I found my first Daedric ruin when I was a very young man. It was a hidden "
"shrine from the past, dedicated to the Anticipations of the Tribunal. I was "
"rounding up a number of kwama scribs that had wandered away from the herd. I "
"followed the scribs into a hidden canyon, when I heard the pathetic cry of a "
"lost scrib emerging from a crack in the canyon wall. I squeezed through the "
"narrow gap to find that it opened into a large depression in the rock. But "
"no simple cave had I wandered into. No, this space was full of carved stone "
"that at once filled me with both wonder and deep fear. For the oppressive "
"blocks of set stone were decorated with patterns of webbing and spider "
"motifs, and the statue at the center of the space depicted none other than "
"the Anticipation of Vivec, the Webspinner Mephala.\n"
"\n"
"Words carved into the base of the statue burned into my memory, never to be "
"forgotten: \"\"Lust is love. Lies are truth. Death is life.\"\" They "
"frightened me, but also excited me. The experience set me on a path that led "
"to madness and knowledge, though where one ends and the other begins, I "
"cannot tell.\n"
"\n"
"I returned to my family's kwama mine, escorting the scribs back to the herd. "
"Then I packed a bag, said goodbye to my mother, and started my search for "
"the hidden shrines and dark places where the Daedric ruins wait to be "
"discovered.\n"
"\n"
"Not every ruined shrine waits beneath the ground. Some hide in open places "
"that are far from inhabited lands. These might be overgrown with vegetation "
"or lost within the folds of rolling hills and craggy canyons. I have even "
"visited a shrine that was hidden beneath the sea.\n"
"\n"
"Those shrines located in underground caves and complexes tend to appear more "
"ominous and oppressive than those happened upon in the great outdoors, but "
"that could just be the influence of the ever-present darkness and awareness "
"of the crushing walls of stone. Some of these ancient shrines stand alone in "
"the darkness, but others serve as the focal points of great complexes, many "
"of which are guarded by elaborate traps or vicious monsters—or both.\n"
"\n"
"I have visited more than a dozen of these Daedric ruins, and a few were not "
"as abandoned and unused as the Temple would have you believe. There are "
"still those among us who honor and even worship the Daedric Princes, and I "
"discovered more than a few fresh offerings and sacrifices in these dark "
"places. But the true secret, the knowledge that has earned me my new name? "
"For that, I must ask you to keep an open mind and a firm resolve, because "
"what I am about to reveal may sound unbelievable. It may even sound like the "
"beginning of a campfire story, one intended to frighten before bedtime. But "
"I assure you, this is no story.\n"
"\n"
"What did I find at that first shrine to the Webspinner that I wandered into "
"by luck and accident? What drove me from my parents' home in search of other "
"Daedric ruins? It was the voice. Beautiful and seductive. It whispered to "
"me, told me secrets that I never should have heard. The whispers emanated "
"from the ancient, cracked statue. They echoed from the cavern walls. They "
"reverberated through my mind, building in volume and intensity until they "
"drowned out my own thoughts and memories. They frightened me, these whispers."
" But they also excited me, and I had to hear more. But the Webspinner was "
"done with me. She imparted her words of wisdom and dark secrets and fell "
"silent. The place was once more abandoned, desolate.\n"
"\n"
"If I wanted to hear more—and I so very much wanted to hear more—I would have "
"to find another shrine. And so my life's work was set before me. I had to "
"find other secret places, other hidden ruins. I had to hear what the other "
"Daedra had to say. Not because I worship them. Not because I had fallen "
"under some dark spell. No, I needed to learn more so that I could share it "
"with the world. It was imperative! It was my duty! But, as I write these "
"words, I find that I can't reveal what the whispers told me. My hand won't "
"put the whispers to paper. It refuses no matter how hard I try!\n"
"\n"
"It seems I have failed in my mission. All I can do is tell you that there "
"are secrets to learn. But it appears that if you want to learn them, you'll "
"have to make the trip yourself. Visit the dark ruins, listen to the whispers."
" Perhaps you'll fare better than I, and the whispers won't drive you mad."

"그들은 나를 미쳤다고 하며 나를 정신병자로 낙인 찍었다. 나는 그들이 나에게 씌워준 칭호를 받아들이고, 명예롭게 받아들인다. 나와 함께 "
"하는 이름은 내가 그 어두운 곳에 몇 번이고 들어갈 의향이 있었음을 보여주기 때문이다. 광기와 혼돈의 폐허를 용감하게 대면하여 이 세상에 "
"지식을 가져다 주는 것이다. 트리뷰널께서는 내가 발견한 것들로부터 나를 보호하시고, 이 지식을 세상과 공유할 수 있을 만큼 내 마음을 "
"맑게 하리라!\n"
"\n"
"나는 아주 어렸을 때 처음으로 데이드릭의 폐허를 발견했다. 그것은 과거로부터 숨겨져 있던 사당으로서, 트리뷰널의 예언을 위해 봉헌되었다. "
"나는 무리에서 멀리 떨어진 여러 개의 크와마 스크립를 찾아 따라가고 있었다. 나는 그 낙서들을 따라 숨겨진 협곡으로 들어갔는데, 그때 "
"협곡 벽의 틈새에서 사라진 스크립의 애처로운 울음소리가 들려왔다. 좁은 틈을 비집고 들어가 바위의 거대한 입구를 열었다. 그러나  동굴은 "
"너무 단순해서 헤멜 수도 없었다. 아니, 이 공간은 조각된 돌들로 가득 차 있었는데, 그 돌은 즉시 나에게 경이로움과 깊은 공포를 주었다."
" 잘 짜여지고 가득찬 블록들은 거미줄 무늬와 거미줄 무늬로 장식되었고, 공간의 중앙에 있는 조각상은 비벡의 예언대로 거미로 묘사되는 "
"메팔라였기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"동상 밑부분에 새겨진 낱말들은 결코 잊혀지지 않는 내 기억 속에 타들어갔다: \\\\\"\\\\\"색욕은 사랑이다. 거짓말은 진실이다. "
"죽음은 생명이다.\\\\\"\\\\\" 이 말은 나를 놀라게 했지만, 나를 흥분시키기도 했다. 그 경험은 나를 광기와 지식으로 이끄는 "
"길로 만들었고, 언제 어디서 어떻게 끝나게 될지 알 수 없었다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 스크립들을 다시 무리로 호송하며 가족의 크와마 광산으로 돌아왔다. 그리고 나는 가방을 싸서 어머니에게 작별 인사를 하고 데이드릭 "
"폐어로부터 발견되기를 바라는 숨겨진 성소들과 어두운 곳을 찾기 시작했다.\n"
"\n"
"모든 폐허가 된 성소들이 지하에 존재하는 건 아니다. 어떤 성소들은 사람이 사는 땅에서 멀리 떨어진 평야에 위치한다. 이것들은 초목으로 "
"가득하거나 구불구불한 언덕과 험준한 협곡들 사이에서 길을 잃을 수도 있다. 나는 기어코 바다 밑에 숨어 있던 성소까지 찾아갔다.\n"
"\n"
"지하 동굴과 구조물들에 위치한 성소들은 거대한 야외에 있는 성소들보다 더 불길하고 나를 짓누르는 것처럼 보이지만, 그것은 단지 지속되는 "
"어둠과 무너지는 돌벽 때문일 수 있다. 이러한 고대 성소들 중 일부는 어둠 속에 홀로 서 있지만, 다른 성소들은 정교한 함정이나 악랄한 "
"괴물들, 또는 둘 다에 의해 지켜지는 거대한 복합체들의 초점 역할을 한다.\n"
"\n"
"나는 이 데이드릭 폐허들 중 십여 곳을 찾아갔는데, 몇몇 폐허들은 당신이 다니는 신전만큼 버려지지도 않았고 새 것 같았다. 우리 중에는 "
"아직도 데이드릭 프린스를 기리고 숭배하는 사람들이 있는데, 나도 이 어두운 곳에서 몇 가지 이상의 신선한 제물과 제물을 발견했다. 하지만 "
"진정한 비밀, -그 지식 때문에 내 새로운 이름이 생겼지?- 그러기 위해서는 열린 마음과 굳은 결심을 지켜 달라고 부탁해야겠다. 왜냐하면 "
"내가 지금 밝히려는 것은 믿을 수 없을 리라고 생각 될 수도 있기 때문이다. 그것은 심지어 잠자기 전에 겁을 주려고 의도한 캠프파이어 "
"이야기의 시작처럼 들릴 수도 있다. 하지만 장담하건대, 이건 꾸며낸 이야기가 아니다.\n"
"\n"
"내가 행운과 우연으로 첫 번째 메팔라 성소에서 무엇을 발견했을지 아는가? 무엇이 나를 다른 데이드릭 폐허를 찾게 부모님 집에서 뛰쳐 "
"나오도록 했을지 아는가? 그 것은 바로 목소리였다. 무척이나 아름답고 유혹적인 목소리였다. 그 목소리는 내게 속삭였고, 절대 들어선 안 "
"될 비밀을 말해줬다. 그리고 그 속삭임들은 고대의 금이 간 조각상으로부터 흘러나왔다. 속삭임은 동굴 벽을 타고 메아리쳤다. 그리고 내 "
"마음 속에도 울려 퍼지며, 내 자신의 생각과 기억을 잠식할 때까지 점점 커지고 무거워졌다. 그 목소리는 나를 두렵게 했다. 하지만 동시에 "
"나를 흥분시켰고, 나는 더 많이 들으려는 욕망에 빠졌다. 하지만 메팔라는 내가 욕망에 빠지자 멈춰버렸다. 그녀는 지혜의 말과 어두운 "
"비밀을 전하고는 조용히 있었다. 그러자 그곳은 다시 한 번 황량해졌다.\n"
"\n"
"만약 내가 더 듣고 싶었고 -무척이나 더 듣고 싶었다- 나는 다른 사당을 찾아야 했다. 그래서 내 숙명은 이제 내 앞에 놓여졌다. 나는 "
"다른 비밀 장소, 다른 숨겨진 폐허를 찾아야만 했다. 다른 데이드릭의 말을 들어야 했다. 내가 그들을 숭배해서가 아니다. 내가 암흑의 "
"주문에 빠져서가 아니다. 단지, 세상에 널리 알릴 수 있도록 더 많은 것을 배울 필요가 있었다. 그건 명령과도 같았다! 그것이 바로 내 "
"의무였다! 그러나, 내가 이 단어들을 쓸 때, 나는 속삭이던 목소리가 나에게 말한 것을 알릴 수 없다는 것을 알게 된다. 내 손이 "
"속삭임을 종이에 쓰지 않는다. 아무리 노력해도 움직이질 않아!\n"
"\n"
"나는 임무에서 실패한 것 같다. 내가 할 수 있는 것은 배울 비밀이 있다는 것뿐이다. 하지만 만약 당신이 그 것을 배우고 싶다면, 당신은 "
"스스로 여행을 떠나야 한다. 어두운 폐허를 찾아가서 속삭이는 소리를 들어라. 아마 넌 나보다 더 잘 할 수도 있을거야. 그리고 속삭이는 "
"소리가 널 미치게 하지는 않겠지."

"From the Journal of Mjahlar Virian\n"
"\n"
"For as long as I can remember, my life has been devoted to one thing: taking "
"the lives of others. These were not random killings. Only those who fell "
"afoul of the law, who wronged the Houses of Morrowind, or who desecrated the "
"sacred teachings of the Tribunal were fair game.\n"
"\n"
"Their lives were mine to take. Given to me, you might say, because they "
"deserved to die. And I was very good at killing.\n"
"\n"
"My victims were mostly unaware that I was coming for them. Some knew they "
"had wronged others: murdered an innocent, stole from the Houses, even bedded "
"another's lover. But they would always claim they had done nothing wrong. "
"That I was mistaken. That I had the wrong man or woman. With a blade at a "
"throat, however, it's amazing how honestly and completely one makes a "
"confession.\n"
"\n"
"One after another, I ended them. A swift slice across the throat. The "
"shallow flesh parted, the thin veins severed cleanly. They would try to "
"scream, but they would only choke on the crimson gore that filled their "
"lungs.\n"
"\n"
"I delighted in death. It filled me with a pleasure I could find in no other "
"activity. This was my life. This was who I was.\n"
"\n"
"People feared me. Loved me. And my brothers and sisters. Pushed us away, and "
"then embraced us as the need arose.\n"
"\n"
"Some days we were hailed as heroes. Others, as murderers. Those in power "
"fell to our secret blades. And then those who gave us the orders followed.\n"
"\n"
"But there was a mistake. A flaw in our process. We had grown too perfect. We "
"had extracted justice from innocent blood.\n"
"\n"
"Such is the way, even with the most clear-cut contract. There is always a "
"chance that the law is wrong. That it made a mistake. The contract never "
"lies, but it isn't always correct, either. Even the smallest of actions, "
"harmless as they may seem, can cause a tidal wave of destruction for those "
"following behind.\n"
"\n"
"A fool's pride veils his judgment. In a moment of passion, blood scrawled "
"upon the wall says it all. \"\"Morag Tong.\"\" Those words scream out, loud "
"and insistent. They echo throughout the world, labeling us as ruthless "
"killers that follow no rules, that have no laws.\n"
"\n"
"The Tong, always hidden, working in secret, suddenly fell under scrutiny. "
"They wanted to drag us out of the shadows and into the light. We withdrew, "
"deeper into the shadows. Our contracts became fewer, our jobs turned into "
"small tasks. We ran errands for bored House nobles. We endured.\n"
"\n"
"And we obeyed. We remained loyal. We swore on our lives to uphold the cause, "
"and we would not turn our backs on it now, no matter the level of difficulty "
"facing us. Even if the world had turned its backs on us, we would stay the "
"course.\n"
"\n"
"Our leaders whisper to us. They tell us to practice patience. They assure us "
"that the day shall come when our hand of justice once again reaches out to "
"grasp the world. A coming darkness will soon sweep the land.\n"
"\n"
"And the Morag Tong will once more be needed. Will once again become relevant."
"\n"
"\n"
"But I am old and my days wind down. I prepare for my trip to Vounoura, and I "
"must pass this mantle to someone younger now. Someone less experienced, less "
"wise. My son and my daughter will soon take up the dagger, but they have not "
"seen our greatness. They must forge a new path for the Morag Tong.\n"
"\n"
"The darkness of war comes, and no one shall be spared from its wrath.\n"
"\n"
"The Morag Tong must put aside the wrongs it has endured. We must be ready."

"\n"
"Reverence: Dunmer from the farthest reaches of Morrowind and beyond arrive "
"each day to pray and show reverence for the Living Gods of the Tribunal. If "

"of action remains the simplest. Do as the Dunmer do. Say what the Dunmer say."

"groomed parks. And know that every purchase you make grants you a little "
"piece of Mournhold to take with you when you depart.\n"

"toward the sky to seek the nourishment of the sun, the citizens of Mournhold "
"raise their arms in prayer to the wisdom of the Tribunal. May you find "
"solace here!\n"
"\n"
"The Tribunal Palace: Many travelers cannot wait to visit the Tribunal "
"Palace, where the Living Gods of Morrowind reside. Please understand that "

"By Drelisa Hlaalu, House Historian\n"
"\n"
"War among the Great Houses of Morrowind isn't unique, and more often than "
"not some kind of conflict between two or more Houses is under way somewhere "
"across the land. Rarely do these conflicts escalate from subterfuge and "
"intrigue to all-out war, but open hostilities aren't unheard of in the "
"history of Morrowind. Let me tell you about one of these wars.\n"
"\n"
"In 2E 559, House Hlaalu and House Dres advanced beyond the usual tensions "
"and posturing and fielded squads of combatants south of Narsis, on the "
"border of the Black Marsh. It wasn't the first time these two economic "
"rivals had challenged each other, and it wouldn't be the last, but the "
"actual war was memorable, both in scope and in the number of casualties that "
"piled up over the course of the battles.\n"
"\n"
"House Hlaalu was determined to set up a trading post in the disputed "
"territory. House Dres was just as determined not to let that happen. Halfway "
"through the construction of the outpost, the House Hlaalu workers suddenly "
"found themselves surrounded by Dres mercenaries. The small squad of Hlaalu "
"guards assigned to protect the workers, led by Purilla Falen, quickly "
"established defenses and prepared to defend the outpost. The Dres "
"mercenaries, who outnumbered the Hlaalu guards five-to-one, assumed they "
"would make short work of the defenders and have the post burned to the "
"ground before the midday meal.\n"
"\n"
"But that's not the way it happened.\n"
"\n"
"Purilla and her guards repelled the first assault with relative ease. She "
"was determined to hold the line, no matter the cost, until reinforcements "
"arrived. To facilitate the appearance of aid, Purilla set the one wizard "
"they brought with them to work on opening a portal to Narsis. If the guards "
"could hold back the onslaught of the Dres mercenaries long enough, an open "
"portal could provide a path for Hlaalu battle-merchants to pour out of to "
"turn the tide of battle. They only needed a little time.\n"
"\n"
"As the wizard performed the portal ritual, Purilla and the defenders met "
"each House Dres attack with skill and ferocity. The mercenaries rushed in, "
"sending a wave of attackers at the post's barricades. Each wave was turned "
"away, but not without a cost. After five hours and four separate waves of "
"attacks, Purilla's forces were reduced to a third of their original size. By "
"then only Purilla and six guards remained to fend off the next Dres assault. "
"And the wizard required a few more minutes to complete the ritual and open "
"the portal. \"\"You shall have that time!\"\" Purilla proclaimed. \"\"For "
"Hlaalu!\"\"\n"
"\n"
"The seven defenders, magnificent in their fury, fought with honor and savage "
"resolve as the wizard completed the final steps of the ritual. One guard "
"fell. Two. Four. Now only Purilla and two Hlaalu guards remained at the "
"battlements. The Hlaalu workers, who had been providing support and watchful "
"eyes throughout the previous battles, took to the walls as well, using tools "
"and the weapons of the fallen guards to help defend the post. For all their "
"effort, it appeared that the crushing weight of the Dres assault was about "
"to engulf them.\n"
"\n"
"And then the portal opened.\n"
"\n"
"House Hlaalu battle-merchants streamed through the portal, hurling spells "
"and arrows into the ranks of the surprised mercenaries. A full cohort "
"emerged from the portal and crashed against the wall of Dres mercenaries. "
"The wall held for a few long moments, and then it shattered against the "
"weight of the Hlaalu troops. Dres mercenaries fell in scores before their "
"line finally broke and the remaining mercenaries turned to flee. The battle-"
"merchants chased after them just long enough to make sure they were really "
"routed, and then they formed up to secure the post.\n"
"\n"
"Brave and noble Purilla Falen was responsible for the Hlaalu victory that "
"day, but she didn't survive the final battle. A Dres mercenary's blade had "
"caught her in the neck as they were retreating. She was dead before a healer "
"could reach her side. Thanks to histories like these, however, her efforts "
"will never be forgotten."

"Observations on the Mabrigash\n"
"from the journals of Bonorion the Wanderer, 2E 568\n"
"\n"
"In Deshaan, I encountered a strange tribe of Dark Elf Ashlanders. They call "
"themselves Mabrigash. Unlike their Vvardenfell brethren, this tribe is not "
"nomadic and appears to have settled in an isolated region of Deshaan, a "
"location they call the Vale of the Ghost Snake. I believe they have "
"concocted the story of the perilous Ghost Snake to discourage outsiders from "
"lingering too long in their village. Although, frankly, their rudeness, "
"which rivals that of any of the more civilized Dark Elves I have ever met, "
"is more than enough to drive outsiders away. However, my curiosity about "
"this isolated tribe steeled me against their attitude. I remained nearby for "
"a time, watching them and recording my observations. Forthwith, here are my "
"findings on the Mabrigash:\n"
"\n"
"The Mabrigash do not welcome visitors.\n"
"\n"
"The Mabrigash appears to be a matriarchal society, and their females are "
"definitely more dominant than males. They also seem to outnumber the males "
"by a factor of three or four to one. I wouldn't say this society hates "
"males, but they certainly don't trust them or like them very much. At least "
"as far as I can tell.\n"
"\n"
"They claim a Ghost Snake gives them advice and watches over the Vale. I "
"believe they use this so-called \"\"Ghost Snake\"\" to scare visitors away "
"and to keep the village population in line.\n"
"\n"
"It appears they sacrifice their own tribe members to this mythical deity. "
"The tribal elders encourage trials to honor this \"\"Ghost Snake,\"\" and "
"many of these end in the death of the participants.\n"
"\n"
"Here is the legend of the Ghost Snake, as it was told to me by a charming "
"little lady of some six or seven years of age. She approached me with "
"absolutely no fear or hesitation. She asked me why I was being so creepy and "
"watching them all the time. At least, that was the gist of it. My "
"understanding of the Mabrigash dialect is rudimentary, at best. I deflected "
"her question with one of my own. \"\"What is this Ghost Snake I keep hearing "
"about?\"\" I asked her.\n"
"\n"
"\"\"Follow the Coiled Path and you'll find out,\"\" she replied with a bat "
"of her cute little eyelashes. \"\"The Ghost Snake offers advice and "
"protection, as long as we care for the Vale,\"\" she continued. "
"\"\"Everybody knows that.\"\" She went on to tell me that the Ghost Snake "
"was the combined spiritual essence of the tribe's female ancestors, given "
"spectral form by the belief and respect of the living tribe members. Or that "
"it was a creepy dead snake that liked to haunt the Vale and eat innocent "
"Mabrigash children. She spoke very fast, and as I've said before, my mastery "
"of the dialect was far from perfect.\n"
"\n"
"From an economic perspective, the tribe crafts unique snakeskin leather. "
"They use this leather for everything, from clothing to packs to a simple "
"armor. They are, however, unwilling to sell or trade this wonderful material "
"to outsiders—or even to the men of their own tribe. Everyone involved could "
"make a fortune if the Mabrigash could be convinced to open trade with the "
"outside world.\n"

"By Kireth Vanos, Dungeon-Delver Extraordinaire\n"
"\n"
"We know almost nothing about them, except that they left behind the most "
"interesting and exciting ruins. You know who I'm talking about. That's "
"right! The Dwarves—or the Dwemer, for the scholars among you who might be "
"reading this. (My brother Raynor insists I call them Dwemer, but I like the "
"name Dwarves better. It rolls off the tongue, in my opinion.)\n"
"\n"
"Now, dungeon-delving is serious work (no matter how much fun it might be), "
"and can be pretty dangerous besides. Just finding a Dwarven ruin is no small "
"accomplishment, but getting into one and back out again in one piece can be "
"next to impossible. But before I get to that, let's talk about the ruins "
"themselves.\n"
"\n"
"Dwarves created a vast network of underground complexes and cities. Why they "
"preferred to build beneath rock and soil, I couldn't say, but that's where "
"they built them. So that's where you'll have to go if you want to visit a "
"Dwarven ruin. Once you do find one, you'll know it. Dwarven architecture has "
"a distinctive look and feel, from the surface entryways to the subterranean "
"structures. They utilized natural openings in the rock wherever possible, "
"tending to decorate and carve existing rock and natural pillars. They only "
"built new structures when it was absolutely necessary, usually to support "
"other structures or to install fortifications.\n"
"\n"
"In addition to carving and shaping the natural rock, Dwarves used stone as "
"their primary building material. Some metal appears within their ruins, "
"primarily brass, used as accents and in mechanical construction. And here's "
"the really exciting part: Dwarves loved their gadgets, and their ruins are "
"full of them! I don't mean just traps, though some of the most devious were "
"designed and built by the long-gone Dwarves. I mean heating and cooling "
"systems made up of steam pistons and great gears, glowing lights that shine "
"from the walls, giant wheels that turn as water cascades over them, "
"multifaceted gems that fire beams of light, and many other wonders too "
"numerous to mention.\n"
"\n"
"It's eerie to walk through a Dwarven ruin. It's supposed to be empty, "
"deserted, but the lights continue to glow and the pipes continue to steam. "
"It's like the place is waiting for someone to return, as though the Dwarves "
"just stepped out for a moment and haven't been gone for hundreds of years.\n"
"\n"
"Then there are the inhabitants of the ruins, for a Dwarven complex isn't as "
"devoid of life as you might think. In fact, some of the ruins virtually teem "
"with the stuff. But it isn't life as you or I know it. It's mechanical life. "
"Constructs. They wander the chambers and corridors of these dungeons, "
"performing tasks assigned to them in ages past. But make no mistake, if a "
"construct spots you, it will attack you. With whirring blades and piston-"
"powered swords, the Dwarven constructs pose a significant threat to any "
"would-be dungeon-delver. Worse, the constructs know how to repair each "
"other, so the ruins seem to contain an endless supply of the mechanical "
"creatures.\n"
"\n"
"So, to successfully enter and exit a Dwarven ruin, you need to spot and "
"disarm (or otherwise bypass) devious traps, avoid or defeat an army of "
"increasingly more powerful wandering constructs, and figure out how to open "
"strange locks that might or might not require something that looks like a "
"key. It can be a bit maddening, but personally I find the challenge to be "
"remarkably fun. \n"
"\n"
"Of course, everything I've written thus far has been theory and conjecture. "
"My brother and I have yet to enter a Dwarven ruin, and all of our practice "
"has been within the mundane dungeons that dot the land. But I've read all "
"the books! We've finally acquired the funding we need to tackle the Dwarven "
"ruin known as Bthanual, and I plan to write about that adventure in the very "
"near future.\n"
"\n"
"In the meantime, let's all be careful out there. Remember that a dungeon "
"isn't all fun and games. Survival is serious business, and we're in this "
"line of work to not only thrive—but to survive!"

"and become leaders in the magical community. Your journey begins here.  \n"
"\n"
"For many, the journey to master magic is fraught with frustration and "
"difficulty. The training provided here can lead to a life of service and "
"rewarding work, thanks to the availability of the best teachers and teaching "
"methods. The fact of the matter is, while everyone invited to the Academy is "
"selected for their potential for greatness, not all of you will measure up "
"to the task before you. For those unfortunate enough to fail, Shad Astula "
"serves as a safety net, a place to refine one's meager skills without "
"causing harm to oneself or to others.\n"
"\n"
"But you will not fail. You are not one of the unfortunates. You will rise "
"above. You will take your place as a leader in the Ebonheart Pact!\n"
"\n"
"You have already realized that you are different from others who can wield "
"the gift of magicka. Now, prepare to be introduced to a world of power. For "
"you, Shad Astula serves as a place where you can spread your wings. With the "
"help of our staff of master mages, you will not only learn to fly, you will "
"soar!\n"
"\n"
"As one of the chosen of the Academy, the usual restrictions and rules that "
"govern the learning of magic do not apply to you. Those rules exist to "
"ensure the safety of mages who may pose a danger to themselves or to others. "
"We anticipate that the Academy's select students will excel, and we believe "
"you're capable of learning your limits quickly. A few guidelines do apply, "
"however:\n"
"\n"
"     —Do not summon creatures from Oblivion planes, except within designated "
"summoning circles.\n"
"     —Magical experimentation on other Academy students is forbidden.\n"
"     —Magical experimentation on non-Academy members is discouraged, but use "
"your best judgment.\n"
"     —Magical experimentation on staff is encouraged. Keep them on their "
"guard, and they'll do the same for you.\n"
"     —Designation of assistants as \"\"minions\"\" is strictly prohibited, "
"and cultist or cabalist behaviors or organizations will be dealt with "
"swiftly and harshly. Save your megalomania for after graduation.\n"
"     —Students who have not passed the Emotional Control and Mental "
"Stability Exam (ECMSE) are forbidden from sharing a room.\n"
"     —Magical dueling is strictly prohibited, except under a staff "
"Battlemage's supervision.\n"
"\n"
"You will soon receive an appointment with the Headmaster, who will have more "
"to say about Shad Astula and your status as a member of the Academy. In the "
"meantime, feel free to explore the campus and introduce yourself to your "
"fellow students. Some will become your peers, others your underlings, and a "
"very select few your betters. Learn them well.\n"
"\n"
"Welcome to Shad Astula. Spread your wings and soar! We expect much of you. "
"Do not disappoint us."

"\n"
"Developing and maintaining a kwama mine can be a rewarding, and more "
"importantly, a lucrative pursuit, provided one takes the time to learn about "
"kwama and their environmental requirements. Kwama are giant insects that "
"live and work in underground colonies called egg mines. Although eggs "
"provide the primary source of income for any kwama mine, they are by no "
"means the only product produced by the mine. Kwama cuttle, scrib jelly, and "
"scrib jerky all provide additional sources of revenue for a kwama mine.\n"
"\n"
"To start a kwama mine:\n"
"\n"
"1a. Find and tame a wild kwama colony (difficult), or\n"
"1b. Purchase excess kwama from a crowded mine (expensive)\n"
"2. Live near the colony until you smell like kwama\n"
"3. Never approach the kwama queen chamber\n"
"4. Gather eggs, collect cuttle\n"
"5. Count your profit\n"
"\n"
"Despite the name, a kwama mine consists of living creatures. With judicious "
"yet unobtrusive maintenance, a moderately-sized mine can produce an "
"abundance of valuable kwama eggs. Kwama mines can also produce tasty scrib "
"jerky, acidic scrib jelly, and kwama cuttle, which is highly valued by "
"alchemists.\n"
"\n"
"The Kwama Colony: The road to owning a profitable mining concern starts with "
"a healthy kwama queen and a full complement of workers. The queen produces "
"eggs in the deepest recesses of the mine. Kwama workers care for the eggs, "
"moving them to the various tunnels and chambers within the mine, according "
"to space requirements, environmental conditions, and the development state "
"of the eggs. Kwama workers also produce food for the mine, feed and clean "
"the queen, and expand the mine complex as the colony grows. When not tending "
"to their usual duties, workers can be seen digging new chambers and tunnels "
"within the ever-growing labyrinth of the mine. Workers tend to be docile, "
"but can turn violent if threatened or attacked, or if the queen is in danger."
"\n"
"\n"
"Kwama warriors protect the colony, reacting quickly to any perceived danger. "
"They should be treated warily and with respect, for they are aggressive and "
"highly dangerous. While workers are quadrupeds, warriors are bipedal and "
"very powerful.\n"
"\n"
"Scribs, as the miners call juvenile kwama, roam freely through a kwama "
"colony. A mine usually splits the scrib herds into two camps: those allowed "
"to grow into workers or warriors, and those harvested while still young for "
"jelly and jerky. Scrib jelly has a variety of uses, including as a food "
"source, but it is prized by alchemists as a key ingredient to create potions "
"and cure diseases. Scrib jerky, made by drying thin slices of scrib meat, "
"has minor restorative properties and is considered to be quite delicious by "
"Dark Elf culinary experts.\n"
"\n"
"Starting a Kwama Mine: Assuming you don't want to pay the exorbitant fees "
"associated with purchasing a queen and kwama from an established mine, you "
"will need to locate and tame a wild colony. This approach isn't without "
"cost, however, as House Hlaalu requires would-be mine owners to purchase a "
"license before hunting for a wild colony in earnest.\n"
"\n"
"When you locate a potential colony, you can't simply walk in and set up shop."
" The colony's aggressive warriors would make short work of your miners. "
"There is a solution: acclimation. The acclimation process takes time, but "
"injury and loss of life (of both colony members and miners) can be minimized "
"by letting the colony slowly become familiar and comfortable with your "
"presence. Once your miners acquire the smell of the local kwama, the "
"warriors will consider them to be part of the colony.  \n"
"\n"
"Egg Harvesting: The actual \"\"mining\"\" of kwama eggs doesn't require a "
"great deal of skill. Miners basically need only patience and common sense to "
"perform their job. Egg harvesting must be done with an eye toward balance. "
"Remove too many eggs and you may agitate the workers and the queen. Remove "
"too few and the queen's egg production may fall. The mine manager must keep "
"a careful eye on production to ensure that the queen does not produce too "
"many or too few eggs. Wide swings in production will affect profits and make "
"planning more difficult, and should be avoided.\n"
"\n"
"Avoid the queen's chamber at all times. Warriors and workers will view any "
"approach to their queen as a threat and react accordingly. Production can "
"grind to a halt as the colony becomes agitated and miners can't safely enter "
"the mine. You might lose a few miners as the colony rampages, but the most "
"important thing to remember is that the kwama will eventually calm down and "
"once again accept the presence of the miners.\n"
"\n"
"Note: House Hlaalu egg-mining licenses require mines to provide regular "
"production reports. Failure to comply can result in sanctions, fines, or "
"even closure of the mine. And that's neither fun nor profitable."

"유일한 생산물이라는 이야기는 절대 아니다. 크와마 커틀, 스크립 젤리, 스크립 육포는 모두 크와마 광산의 추가 소득원이다.\n"
"\n"

"커틀도 생산된다.\n"
"\n"
"크와마의 무리사회: 높은 이윤을 내는 크와마 광산을 소유하는 길은 건강한 여왕크와마와, 그를 잘 보조하는 일꾼들에게서 시작한다. "
"여왕크와마는 광산의 가장 깊고 후미진 곳에 알을 낳는다. 일꾼크와마들은 알을 돌보며, 굴의 공간과 주변 환경 상태, 그리고 알의 "
"발달상태에 따라 알들을 터널과 방 이곳저곳으로 옮긴다. 일꾼크와마들은 또한 먹이를 생산하고, 여왕을 먹이고 씻기며, 무리가 커짐에 따라 "
"광산을 확장하는 일도 한다. 평소 하는 일들을 하고 있지 않을 때에는 무한히 확장하는 미궁과도 같은 광산 안에 새로운 방과 터널을 파내는 "
"일꾼들을 볼 수 있다. 일꾼크와마들은 유순하나, 위협을 느끼거나 공격당했을 때, 혹은 여왕이 위험에 처했을 때에는 공격적으로 변할 수 "
"있다.\n"
"\n"
"병정크와마들은 무리를 지키며, 위험이 감지되면 재빨리 행동한다. 병정크와마를 대할 때는 방심하면 안 되고 자극하지 않아야 한다. 그들은 "
"공격적이고 아주 위험하다. 일꾼크와마들은 사족보행을 하지만, 병정들은 이족보행을 하며 아주 강하다.\n"
"\n"
"크와마 광산업자들은 어린 크와마를 스크립이라고 부른다. 스크립은 크와마 무리 사이를 자유롭게 다닌다. 보통 광산에서는 스크립을 두 무리로 "
"나누어 관리한다. 일꾼이나 병정크와마로 자라게 두는 무리와, 어릴 때 도살하여 젤리와 육포를 얻는 무리이다. 스크립 젤리는 음식 재료로 "
"쓰이는 것을 포함해 다양한 용도가 있지만, 특히 연금술사들이 포션을 만들거나 질병을 치료하는 데 꼭 필요한 핵심 재료이다. 스크립 고기를 "
"얇게 저며 말린 스크립 육포는 강장 효과가 약간 있으며, 다크 엘프 요리 전문가들에게 별미로 통한다.\n"
"\n"
"크와마 광산을 시작하려면: 이미 운영되는 광산에서 말도 안 되는 값을 주고 크와마 여왕과 다른 크와마들을 구매하려는 게 아니라면, 야생 "
"크와마 무리를 찾아서 길들여야 한다. 이 방법 또한 아예 비용이 들지 않는 것은 아닌데, 광산 소유주가 되려는 사람은 본격적으로 야생 "
"크와마를 찾아 나서기 전에 할루 가문의 허가증을 구입해야 하기 때문이다.\n"
"\n"
"길들일 만한 무리를 발견한 뒤에도, 그냥 걸어 들어가서 사업을 시작할 순 없다. 공격적인 병정크와마들이 광산 노동자들을 해치워 버릴 "
"것이다. 그 해결책으로 순치가 필요하다. 순치 과정에는 시간이 드나, 무리가 당신의 존재에 서서히 익숙해지게 함으로서 무리의 크와마와 "
"광산 노동자 모두의 부상이나 사망을 막을 수 있다. 광산 노동자들에게서 그 지역 크와마의 냄새가 나기 시작하면, 병정크와마들은 노동자들을 "
"무리의 일부로 여기게 될 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"알 수확하기: 크와마 알을 ‘채굴’하는 일에는 별다른 기술이 필요 없다. 광산 노동자들에게는 참을성 약간과 일반 상식만 있으면 된다. 알 "
"수확은 균형을 주시하며 이루어져야 한다. 너무 많은 알을 가져가면 일꾼들과 여왕이 동요하게 된다. 너무 적은 알을 가져가면 여왕크와마의 "
"알 생산량이 감소한다. 광산 관리감독은 여왕이 알을 너무 많이 낳거나 너무 적게 낳지는 않는지 항상 생산량을 눈여겨보아야 한다. 생산량의 "
"급변은 이윤에 영향을 주고 계획을 세우는 것을 어렵게 하므로 피해야 한다.\n"
"\n"
"절대 여왕의 방에 가까이 가지 않도록 한다. 일꾼과 병정크와마들은 여왕에게 다가가는 무엇이든 위협으로 간주하고 반응한다. 알 생산은 "
"중단될 가능성이 있고 무리가 동요하여 노동자들이 안전하게 광산 안으로 들어갈 수 없게 된다. 무리가 날뛰면 일꾼 몇을 잃게 될 수도 "
"있으나, 가장 중요한 사실은 결국 언젠가는 크와마들이 진정하게 되고 광산 노동자들의 존재를 다시 받아들이게 된다는 것이다.\n"
"\n"
"참고: 할루 가문의 크와마 광산 허가에는 정기적인 생산량 보고 조건이 있다. 이를 지키지 못할 시에는 제재가 가해질 수 있고, 벌금을 "
"물거나 심할 경우 광산이 폐쇄될 수도 있다. 재미도 없고 돈도 안 되는 일이다."

"\n"
"Veloth's Judgment rang with authority throughout the land, using its "
